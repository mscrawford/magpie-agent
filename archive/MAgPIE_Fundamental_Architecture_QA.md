## 1. What is a cluster (j)? Relationship to 0.5 degree

### Cluster Definition

**üü¢ Verified**: `core/sets.gms:56-68`

```gams
j number of LPJ cells
  / CAZ_1*CAZ_5,
    CHA_6*CHA_24,
    EUR_25*EUR_36,
    IND_37*IND_48,
    JPN_49*JPN_55,
    LAM_56*LAM_88,
    MEA_89*MEA_113,
    NEU_114*NEU_121,
    OAS_122*OAS_137,
    REF_138*REF_149,
    SSA_150*SSA_182,
    USA_183*USA_200 /
```

**Definition**: `j` represents **200 spatial clusters** used as simulation units for the optimization process.

### Relationship to 0.5 Degree Resolution

**üü¢ Verified**: `main.gms:28, 63-65`

From main.gms documentation:
> "Geographically explicit data on biophysical conditions are provided by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land model (LPJmL) on a **0.5 degree resolution** and include e.g. carbon densities of different vegetation types, agricultural productivity such as crop yields and water availability for irrigation."

> "Due to computational constraints, all model inputs in **0.5 degree resolution are aggregated to simulation units** for the optimization process based on a **clustering algorithm**."

### Clustering Methodology

**üü° From literature.bib and main.gms**:

The clustering approach (Dietrich et al. 2013):
- Uses **bottom-up clustering** algorithm
- Delivers **higher degree of information conservation** than simple grid-based aggregation
- Reduces loss of information by choosing appropriate aggregation pattern
- Groups similar 0.5¬∞ grid cells based on biophysical characteristics

### Cluster Distribution by Region

**üü¢ Verified**: `main.gms:156-157`

```
Number of cells per region:
  CAZ  CHA  EUR  IND  JPN  LAM  MEA  NEU  OAS  REF  SSA  USA
    5   19   12   12    7   33   25    8   16   12   33   18

Total: 200 clusters
```

### Key Implications

1. **Each cluster** aggregates multiple 0.5¬∞ grid cells with similar biophysical properties
2. **Computational tractability**: 200 clusters instead of ~60,000 global 0.5¬∞ cells
3. **Information preservation**: Clustering maintains regional heterogeneity better than uniform grid aggregation
4. **Spatial resolution**: All optimization variables exist at cluster level (land use, water, production, etc.)

---

## 2. Recursive Dynamic vs Perfect Foresight

### Answer: MAgPIE uses RECURSIVE DYNAMIC optimization

**üü¢ Verified**: `core/calculations.gms:40-99`

### Code Evidence

```gams
loop (t$(m_year(t) > %TIMESTEP%),

* set ct to current time period
    ct(t) = yes;
    pt(t) = yes$(ord(t) = 1);
    pt(t-1) = yes$(ord(t) > 1);

      display "Year";
      display ct;
      display "Previous Year";
      display pt;

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" presolve

* intersolve for food demand model
  sm_intersolve=0;

  while(sm_intersolve = 0,

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" solve    # SOLVE happens HERE

* intersolve for food demand model
    sm_intersolve=1;

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" intersolve

  );

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" postsolve

* clear ct and pt set
  ct(t) = no;
  pt(t-1) = no$(ord(t) > 1);

);
```

### How Recursive Dynamic Works

**üü° Confirmed**: `Phase1_Core_Architecture.md:5-11, 206-217`

**Time Step Execution**:
```
FOR each time step t:
    1. Set ct(t) = current time
    2. Execute all module preloop phases
    3. Execute all module presolve phases
    4. SOLVE optimization model              ‚Üê Only for current time step!
    5. Execute all module postsolve phases
    6. Store results
    7. Advance to next time step
```

**Key Characteristics**:
1. Model loops through time periods **sequentially** (typically 5-year intervals: 1995, 2000, 2005, ..., 2100)
2. At each time step, optimization sees:
   - **Current conditions** (ct = current time)
   - **Previous time step results** (pt = previous time)
   - **NO future information** (future time steps not yet solved)
3. Solution from time `t` becomes initial conditions for time `t+1`
4. Model solves ~18-20 independent optimization problems (one per time step)

### Temporal Resolution

**üü¢ Verified**: `core/sets.gms:142-217`

```gams
t_ext 5-year time periods
/
y1965, y1970, y1975, y1980, y1985, y1990,
y1995, y2000, y2005, y2010, y2015, y2020, y2025, y2030, y2035, y2040,
y2045, y2050, y2055, y2060, y2065, y2070, y2075, y2080, y2085, y2090,
y2095, y2100, y2105, y2110, y2115, y2120, y2125, y2130, y2135, y2140,
y2145, y2150, ...
/
```

Default simulation: `coup2100` runs from 1995 to 2100 in 5-year steps.

## 3. Implications of Recursive Dynamic Optimization

### Vs. Perfect Foresight

| Aspect | Recursive Dynamic (MAgPIE) | Perfect Foresight |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Time periods solved** | One at a time, sequentially | All simultaneously |
| **Future knowledge** | None (myopic) | Complete (omniscient) |
| **Problem size** | Small (200 clusters √ó current time) | Large (200 clusters √ó all time steps) |
| **Computational cost** | Low (per time step) | Very high |
| **Path dependency** | Yes (past decisions constrain future) | No (globally optimal path) |
| **Realism** | High (agents don't know future) | Low (unrealistic foresight) |

### ‚úÖ Advantages

1. **Computationally feasible**:
   - Each solve: ~1M variables, ~100K constraints
   - 20 solves instead of 1 massive solve with 20M variables

2. **Realistic decision-making**:
   - Agents make decisions based on **current information**
   - Matches real-world behavior (farmers, policymakers don't know 2100 prices)

3. **Flexibility for scenario design**:
   - Can introduce shocks between time steps
   - Policy changes can be implemented mid-simulation
   - Easy to restart from any time step

4. **Handles uncertainty**:
   - Future inherently unknown
   - Decisions based on observable trends and current conditions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **No intertemporal optimization**:
   - Cannot optimize multi-decade investments (e.g., afforestation that matures in 50 years)
   - Each time step optimizes myopically

2. **Path dependency**:
   - Suboptimal early decisions cannot be "undone"
   - Lock-in effects (infrastructure, land conversion)

3. **No anticipation**:
   - Model cannot anticipate future carbon tax unless parameterized
   - Investment in R&D doesn't account for future demand

4. **Potential inefficiency**:
   - May oscillate (invest heavily one period, divest next)
   - Transition costs not fully optimized across time

### üîß How MAgPIE Mitigates Limitations

1. **Exogenous trajectories inform decisions**:
   - Demand scenarios (Module 16) provide forward-looking expectations
   - Bioenergy demand (Module 60) signals future requirements
   - Climate scenarios (Module 45) guide adaptation

2. **Investment dynamics**:
   - Technological change (Module 13) creates persistent effects
   - Interest rates (Module 12) value future benefits

3. **Myopic foresight parameters**:
   - Some modules use expectations (e.g., projected yields inform investment)
   - Calibration ensures reasonable transition paths

4. **Iterative solving**:
   - Food demand model uses `sm_intersolve` to iterate within time step (core/calculations.gms:55-81)
   - Achieves internal consistency at each time step

---

## 3. Can a cluster belong to multiple regions?

### Answer: NO - Each cluster belongs to exactly ONE region

**üü¢ Verified**: `core/sets.gms:70-82`

### Code Evidence

```gams
cell(i,j) number of LPJ cells per region i
  / CAZ . (CAZ_1*CAZ_5)       # CAZ_1 through CAZ_5 belong ONLY to CAZ
    CHA . (CHA_6*CHA_24)      # CHA_6 through CHA_24 belong ONLY to CHA
    EUR . (EUR_25*EUR_36)     # EUR_25 through EUR_36 belong ONLY to EUR
    IND . (IND_37*IND_48)
    JPN . (JPN_49*JPN_55)
    LAM . (LAM_56*LAM_88)
    MEA . (MEA_89*MEA_113)
    NEU . (NEU_114*NEU_121)
    OAS . (OAS_122*OAS_137)
    REF . (REF_138*REF_149)
    SSA . (SSA_150*SSA_182)
    USA . (USA_183*USA_200) /
```

### Key Observations

1. **Naming convention**: Each cluster has a region prefix (e.g., `CAZ_1`, `CHA_6`, `USA_183`)
2. **Sequential numbering**: Cluster IDs are region-specific and non-overlapping
3. **Mapping structure**: `cell(i,j)` is a 2-dimensional set defining one-to-one cluster-region relationship
4. **No overlap**: Each cluster `j` appears in exactly one region's list

### Regional Distribution

**üü¢ Verified**: `main.gms:156-157`

```
CAZ: clusters 1-5      (5 clusters)
CHA: clusters 6-24     (19 clusters)
EUR: clusters 25-36    (12 clusters)
IND: clusters 37-48    (12 clusters)
JPN: clusters 49-55    (7 clusters)
LAM: clusters 56-88    (33 clusters)
MEA: clusters 89-113   (25 clusters)
NEU: clusters 114-121  (8 clusters)
OAS: clusters 122-137  (16 clusters)
REF: clusters 138-149  (12 clusters)
SSA: clusters 150-182  (33 clusters)
USA: clusters 183-200  (18 clusters)

Total: 200 clusters (no overlap)
```

### Implications

1. **Unambiguous regional assignment**: Every piece of land belongs to exactly one economic region
2. **Regional policy enforcement**: Conservation targets, subsidies, trade rules apply cleanly
3. **Trade flows are well-defined**: Production in cluster `j` belongs to region `i`, exports handled by Module 21
4. **Regional aggregation is straightforward**:
   ```gams
   vm_land_reg(i) = sum(j$cell(i,j), vm_land(j));
   ```
5. **No cross-border clusters**: Even though 0.5¬∞ grid cells might span borders, aggregated clusters don't

## 4. Purpose of i2 and j2 sets

### Answer: Dynamic set management for efficiency and flexibility

**üü¢ Verified**: `core/sets.gms:119-127`

### Code Definition

```gams
sets
    h2(h) Superregional (dynamic set)
    i2(i) World regions (dynamic set)
    j2(j) Spatial Clusters (dynamic set)
;

h2(h) = yes;  # Initialize: all superregions active
i2(i) = yes;  # Initialize: all 12 regions active
j2(j) = yes;  # Initialize: all 200 clusters active
```

### Static vs Dynamic Sets

**üü° From Phase1_Core_Architecture.md:307-313**

| Set | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `i` | **Static** | Full universe of regions (12 always) |
| `i2` | **Dynamic** | Active subset of regions (can change) |
| `j` | **Static** | Full universe of clusters (200 always) |
| `j2` | **Dynamic** | Active subset of clusters (can change) |

### Use Cases

#### 1. **Conditional Execution**

**Inefficient** (loops over ALL clusters always):
```gams
loop(j,
    vm_land(j) = pm_land_initial(j);
);
# 200 iterations every time, even if only 50 clusters relevant
```

**Efficient** (loops over only active clusters):
```gams
loop(j2,
    vm_land(j2) = pm_land_initial(j2);
);
# N iterations where N = number of active clusters in j2
```

#### 2. **Scenario-Specific Coverage**

Restrict model to specific regions/clusters:
```gams
# Europe-only scenario
i2(i) = no;           # Deactivate all regions
i2("EUR") = yes;      # Activate only Europe

# Corresponding clusters
j2(j) = no;           # Deactivate all clusters
j2(j)$cell("EUR",j) = yes;  # Activate only European clusters
```

#### 3. **Time-Dependent Activation**

Regions "enter" model at different times:
```gams
# In preloop phase:
if(m_year(ct) >= 2030,
    i2("NEU") = yes;  # Northern Europe enters in 2030
);
```

#### 4. **Solver Performance Optimization**

Equations defined over `i2` and `j2` generate fewer variables/constraints:

```gams
# Without dynamic sets (wasteful)
q_land_balance(j) ..
    sum(land, vm_land(j,land)) =e= pm_land_tot(j);
# Generates 200 equations always, even if only solving for 50 clusters

# With dynamic sets (efficient)
q_land_balance(j2) ..
    sum(land, vm_land(j2,land)) =e= pm_land_tot(j2);
# Generates N equations where N = |j2| (active clusters only)
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduced memory usage
- Faster solver initialization
- Smaller constraint matrix
- Faster solve times

#### 5. **Testing and Debugging**

Quick scenario testing:
```gams
# Test on single cluster
j2(j) = no;
j2("CAZ_1") = yes;

# Test on single region
i2(i) = no;
i2("USA") = yes;
j2(j) = no;
j2(j)$cell("USA",j) = yes;
```

### Common Pattern in Modules

**Typical equation structure**:
```gams
equations
    q_some_constraint(i,j,t)    # Declared over full dimensions
;

# But defined only for active sets:
q_some_constraint(i2,j2,ct) ..
    vm_variable(i2,j2,ct) =l= pm_parameter(i2,j2,ct);
```

### Why Have Both?

| Purpose | Use Static (i, j) | Use Dynamic (i2, j2) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Data structures** | ‚úÖ Define parameter dimensions | ‚ùå |
| **Data loading** | ‚úÖ Load data for all regions/clusters | ‚ùå |
| **Equation definition** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Define constraints only where active |
| **Loop execution** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Iterate only over active elements |
| **Output reporting** | ‚úÖ Report full spatial coverage | ‚ùå |

**Flexibility**: Data exists for all `i` and `j`, but optimization solves only for active `i2` and `j2`.

## 5. Global Objective with Local Constraints

### Question: How does a global objective function work with cluster/regional constraints?

### Answer: Standard mixed-integer/nonlinear programming structure

**üü¢ Verified**: `modules/80_optimization/nlp_apr17/solve.gms:34`

```gams
solve magpie USING nlp MINIMIZING vm_cost_glo;
```

### Objective Function Structure

The global objective is an **aggregation** of regional/cluster costs:

```gams
vm_cost_glo                          # Single global variable (scalar)
    = sum(i, vm_cost_reg(i))         # Sum of regional costs
    = sum(i, sum(j$cell(i,j), vm_cost_cluster(j)))  # Which aggregate cluster costs
```

**Example** (Module 11 would define):
```gams
equations
    q11_cost_glo      Global cost aggregation
    q11_cost_reg(i)   Regional cost aggregation
;

q11_cost_glo ..
    vm_cost_glo =e= sum(i2, vm_cost_reg(i2));

q11_cost_reg(i2) ..
    vm_cost_reg(i2) =e= sum(cell(i2,j2),
                           v11_prod_cost(j2)
                         + v11_transport_cost(j2)
                         + v11_conversion_cost(j2)
                         + v11_factor_cost(j2));
```

### Multi-Level Constraint Structure

Constraints exist at different spatial scales:

#### **Cluster-Level Constraints** (Most detailed - ~200 constraints)

```gams
# Land balance at each cluster (Module 10)
q10_land(j2) ..
    sum(land, vm_land(j2,land)) =e= pm_land_tot(j2);

# Water availability at each cluster (Module 42)
q42_water(j2) ..
    sum(wat_dem, vm_wat_usage(j2,wat_dem)) =l= pm_wat_avail(j2);

# Crop area allocation (Module 30)
q30_croparea(j2) ..
    sum(kcr, vm_area(j2,kcr)) =e= vm_land(j2,"crop");
```

#### **Regional-Level Constraints** (~12 constraints)

```gams
# Regional self-sufficiency (Module 21)
q21_selfsuff(i2,kall) ..
    vm_prod_reg(i2,kall) + vm_import(i2,kall)
        =g= s21_selfsuff_factor * vm_food_demand(i2,kall);

# Regional emission limits (Module 56)
q56_emis_regional(i2) ..
    sum(emis_source, vm_emissions(i2,emis_source)) =l= pm_emis_limit_reg(i2);
```

#### **Global Constraints** (1-10 constraints)

```gams
# Global GHG emissions (Module 56)
q56_emis_global ..
    sum(i2, sum(emis_source, vm_emissions(i2,emis_source))) =l= s56_ghg_budget;

# Global cropland limit (Module 10)
q10_cropland_global ..
    sum(i2, sum(cell(i2,j2), vm_land(j2,"crop"))) =l= s10_cropland_max;

# Global biodiversity (Module 44)
q44_bii_global ..
    sum(i2, sum(cell(i2,j2), v44_bii_weighted(j2))) =g= s44_bii_target;
```

### How the Solver Works

The NLP solver (typically CONOPT) simultaneously:

1. **Minimizes**: `vm_cost_glo` (single scalar variable)
2. **Subject to**: ALL constraints at ALL spatial levels
   - ~200 land balance constraints (one per cluster)
   - ~200 water constraints (one per cluster)
   - ~2000 crop area constraints (one per cluster √ó crop type)
   - ~12 regional trade constraints (one per region)
   - ~10 global policy constraints
   - **Total: ~100,000+ constraints**

3. **Finds values for**: ALL variables
   - `vm_land(j,land)`: ~1,400 variables (200 clusters √ó 7 land types)
   - `vm_area(j,kcr,w)`: ~12,000 variables (200 clusters √ó 20 crops √ó 2 water types)
   - `vm_prod_reg(i,kall)`: ~600 variables (12 regions √ó 50 products)
   - `vm_trade(i,kall)`: ~600 variables
   - **Total: ~1,000,000+ variables**

### Why This Structure is Powerful

#### **Global Minimization** means:

- Model finds **globally cost-minimizing** allocation
- Comparative advantage drives decisions:
  - Crops grown where yields highest and costs lowest
  - Trade flows from efficient producers to consumers
  - Land use allocated to most productive uses

#### **Local Constraints** ensure:

- **Physical feasibility**:
  - Can't use more land than exists in cluster
  - Can't use more water than available
  - Can't emit more than biophysical limits

- **Regional policies**:
  - Self-sufficiency requirements enforced per region
  - Regional conservation quotas respected
  - Regional emission targets met

- **Global policies**:
  - Global climate targets enforced
  - Global biodiversity goals achieved
  - Global resource limits respected

### Concrete Example (Illustrative)

**Optimization problem**:
```
Minimize:  vm_cost_glo = 1000 billion USD

Subject to:
  [Cluster CAZ_1] vm_land(CAZ_1,"crop") ‚â§ 50 Mha         (land availability)
  [Cluster LAM_60] vm_land(LAM_60,"crop") ‚â§ 100 Mha      (land availability)
  [Cluster EUR_30] vm_land(EUR_30,"crop") ‚â§ 30 Mha       (land availability)
  ...
  [Region EUR] vm_prod_reg(EUR,"tece") ‚â• 0.8 √ó vm_demand(EUR,"tece")  (self-sufficiency)
  [Global] sum(i, vm_emissions(i)) ‚â§ 500 Mt CO2           (climate target)
```

**Solution might allocate** (made-up illustrative numbers):
- Brazil cluster (LAM_60): 80 Mha cropland
  - Low production cost: $100/ha
  - High yield: 5 t/ha
  - Exports surplus to world market

- Europe cluster (EUR_30): 25 Mha cropland
  - High production cost: $500/ha
  - Lower yield: 3 t/ha
  - Needed to meet EU self-sufficiency constraint

- Canada cluster (CAZ_1): 10 Mha cropland
  - Medium cost: $200/ha
  - Medium yield: 4 t/ha
  - Exports to high-cost regions

**Global minimum** ($1000B) is achieved by:
- Producing where cheapest (Brazil)
- Respecting physical limits (land availability)
- Meeting policy constraints (EU self-sufficiency)
- Satisfying climate target (global emissions)

### Mathematical Formulation

```
Minimize:
    vm_cost_glo

Subject to:
    # Cluster-level physical constraints
    ‚àÄj ‚àà j2:  sum(land, vm_land(j,land)) = pm_land_tot(j)
    ‚àÄj ‚àà j2:  vm_water_use(j) ‚â§ pm_water_avail(j)
    ‚àÄj ‚àà j2:  sum(kcr, vm_area(j,kcr)) = vm_land(j,"crop")

    # Regional policy constraints
    ‚àÄi ‚àà i2, k ‚àà kall:  vm_prod(i,k) + vm_import(i,k) ‚â• sf √ó vm_demand(i,k)
    ‚àÄi ‚àà i2:  vm_emissions_reg(i) ‚â§ pm_emis_limit(i)

    # Global constraints
    sum(i, vm_emissions(i)) ‚â§ s_ghg_budget
    sum(i, sum(j, vm_land(j,"primforest"))) ‚â• s_forest_conservation

    # Variable bounds
    vm_land(j,land) ‚â• 0
    vm_area(j,kcr,w) ‚â• 0
    ...

Variables:
    vm_cost_glo                    (1 variable - objective)
    vm_land(j,land)                (200 √ó 7 = 1,400 variables)
    vm_area(j,kcr,w)               (200 √ó 20 √ó 2 = 8,000 variables)
    vm_prod_reg(i,k)               (12 √ó 50 = 600 variables)
    ... 1,000,000+ total variables

Constraint count:
    ~200 cluster land balances
    ~200 cluster water limits
    ~8,000 cluster crop area constraints
    ~600 regional production constraints
    ~600 regional trade constraints
    ~10 global policy constraints
    ... ~100,000+ total constraints
```

**Result**: Solver finds values for ~1M variables that satisfy ~100K constraints while minimizing the single global cost objective.

### Why Not Regional Objectives?

MAgPIE could theoretically have **regional objectives** (e.g., minimize each region's cost independently). But this would:

‚ùå **Lose comparative advantage**: Regions wouldn't trade efficiently
‚ùå **Miss global optimum**: Sum of regional optima ‚â† global optimum
‚ùå **Ignore spillovers**: Emissions, trade, deforestation affect other regions

‚úÖ **Global objective captures**:
- Efficient trade: Produce where cheap, import where expensive
- Global climate goals: Minimize total emissions across all regions
- Land-use efficiency: Allocate globally scarce land to highest-value uses

**Local constraints** prevent:
- Violating physical limits (land, water)
- Ignoring regional policies (self-sufficiency, conservation)
- Unrealistic spatial concentration (all production in one cluster)

| **Cluster in 2 regions?** | NO - Each cluster belongs to exactly one region, defined by cell(i,j) mapping. Cluster naming enforces this (e.g., CAZ_1, CHA_6). | üü¢ core/sets.gms:70-82 |
| **Purpose of i2, j2?** | Dynamic subsets for (1) conditional execution, (2) scenario control, (3) time-dependent activation, (4) solver performance, (5) testing. Separate static sets (i,j) define full universe, dynamic (i2,j2) define active elements. | üü¢ core/sets.gms:119-127 |
| **Global objective + local constraints?** | Standard NLP optimization: Minimize single global cost (vm_cost_glo) subject to ~100K constraints at cluster/regional/global levels. Solver finds ~1M variable values satisfying all constraints while minimizing objective. | üü¢ modules/80_optimization/nlp_apr17/solve.gms:34 |
