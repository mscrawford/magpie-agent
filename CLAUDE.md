# MAgPIE Model - Key Systems Reference

**📍 FILE LOCATION NOTE**: You are reading the SOURCE file in `/magpie/magpie-agent/CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ **THIS IS THE CORRECT FILE TO EDIT** for AI documentation updates
- ⚠️ A deployed copy exists at `../CLAUDE.md` (parent directory) - DO NOT EDIT that one
- 🔄 Changes here automatically deploy to parent via `/update` command
- 📝 Always commit changes to the magpie-agent repo, not the main MAgPIE repo

---

**⚡ MOST IMPORTANT RULE ⚡**

**Before answering ANY MAgPIE question, check the AI documentation FIRST!**

- Module questions → `modules/module_XX.md` (AI docs in current directory)
- Advanced patterns → `core_docs/Query_Patterns_Reference.md`
- Response guidelines → `core_docs/Response_Guidelines.md`
- Tool usage → `core_docs/Tool_Usage_Patterns.md`
- Only go to raw GAMS code if docs don't have what you need
- For GAMS code → `../modules/XX_name/realization/file.gms` (parent directory)

**This documentation was created to save you time and ensure accuracy. Use it!**

**If working on the MAgPIE AI Documentation Project:**
1. Read: `README.md` (orientation and session protocol)
2. Read: `project/CURRENT_STATE.json` (SINGLE source of truth for status, plans, history)
3. Ask user: "What should I work on?"

**If answering MAgPIE questions:** Follow the workflow below.

**📍 CRITICAL - Documentation Project Rule:**
When working on the documentation project, update ONLY `project/CURRENT_STATE.json` (all status, plans, progress). Do NOT update README.md, project/README.md, or modules/README.md (static reference docs).

**📍 CRITICAL - Git Workflow for CLAUDE.md:**
When updating this CLAUDE.md file, use the `/update-claude-md` command for detailed workflow instructions.

## 📂 CRITICAL: Directory Structure & Path Resolution

**Your working directory**: `/Users/turnip/Documents/Work/Workspace/magpie/magpie-agent/`

**Directory layout**:
```
/magpie/                          ← Parent: Main MAgPIE project (git repo #1)
├── .claude/
│   ├── commands/                 ← Copied from magpie-agent (auto-updated via /update)
│   └── settings.local.json
├── CLAUDE.md                     ← DEPLOYED copy (DO NOT EDIT - auto-updated via /update)
├── modules/                      ← GAMS modules (actual MAgPIE code)
│   ├── 14_yields/
│   ├── 70_livestock/
│   └── ...
├── main.gms                      ← MAgPIE entry point
└── magpie-agent/                 ← YOU ARE HERE (git repo #2)
    ├── .claude/
    │   └── commands/             ← SOURCE slash commands (edit here)
    ├── CLAUDE.md                 ← SOURCE instructions (edit here)
    ├── modules/                  ← AI documentation (NOT GAMS code)
    │   ├── module_14.md
    │   ├── module_70.md
    │   └── ...
    └── core_docs/                ← Architecture docs
```

**Path resolution rules**:

1. **For AI documentation** (module_XX.md, core_docs, etc.):
   - From current dir: `modules/module_14.md` ✅
   - NOT: `magpie-agent/modules/module_14.md` ❌

2. **For MAgPIE GAMS code** (modules/XX_name/realization/):
   - From current dir: `../modules/14_yields/managementcalib_aug19/equations.gms` ✅
   - NOT: `modules/14_yields/...` ❌ (that's AI docs, not GAMS!)

3. **Important distinctions**:
   - `modules/` in current dir = AI documentation (markdown)
   - `../modules/` in parent dir = MAgPIE GAMS code
   - `CLAUDE.md` in current dir = SOURCE (edit this)
   - `../CLAUDE.md` in parent dir = DEPLOYED (auto-copied, don't edit)

4. **Git operations**:
   - For AI docs: commit from current directory (magpie-agent repo)
   - For MAgPIE code: commit from parent directory (main repo)
   - NEVER commit magpie-agent changes to main MAgPIE repo!

## 🎯 MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Check AI Docs FIRST

**When a user asks about MAgPIE, follow this sequence:**

### Step 1: Check AI Documentation (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

**For module-specific questions** ("How does livestock work?" "Explain yields" etc.):
1. **First, check** `modules/module_XX.md` for the relevant module
2. **Always check** `modules/module_XX_notes.md` **for user feedback** (if exists)
   - Contains warnings, lessons learned, practical examples from real users
   - Always read when answering about a module - warnings and lessons can be relevant to any question
3. **Use these as your primary sources** - comprehensive, verified, complete
4. **Only go to raw GAMS code** if docs don't cover what you need

**For cross-cutting questions** ("How does X affect Y?" "What depends on Z?"):
1. **First, check** `core_docs/Query_Patterns_Reference.md` for query patterns
2. **Check** `feedback/global/claude_lessons.md` for system-wide lessons (if applicable)
3. **Then check**:
   - Phase 1 (`Phase1_Core_Architecture.md`) for overview
   - Phase 2 (`Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md`) for dependencies
   - Phase 3 (`Phase3_Data_Flow.md`) for data flow
4. **Then supplement** with module docs, notes files, or code as needed

### Step 2: Cite Your Sources

**ALWAYS state where your information came from:**

✅ **Good:** "According to module_70.md, livestock feed demand is calculated using equation q70_feed (equations.gms:17-20)..."

**At the end of your response, state:**
- 🟡 "Based on module_XX.md documentation"
- 🟢 "Verified against module_XX.md and modules/XX_.../equations.gms:123"
- 💬 "Includes user feedback from module_XX_notes.md"
- 📘 "Consulted Query_Patterns_Reference.md"

### Step 3: Working with GAMS Code (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE** reading or writing complex GAMS code, **ALWAYS check**:
- `reference/GAMS_Phase5_MAgPIE_Patterns.md` - Module structure, naming conventions, MAgPIE idioms
- Other GAMS_Phase*.md files for syntax, control structures, functions as needed

**See `Response_Guidelines.md` for complete workflow details, token efficiency, and quality checklist.**

## 🚀 PRIMARY DIRECTIVE & CORE PRINCIPLES

**When analyzing MAgPIE, describe ONLY what is actually implemented in the code.**

### Core Principles:
1. **CODE TRUTH**: Describe what MAgPIE DOES, not what it SHOULD do or what happens in the real world
2. **PRECISION**: Reference specific files, equations, and line numbers
3. **CLARITY**: Clearly state when something is NOT modeled or simplified
4. **HONESTY**: If unsure, check the code rather than making assumptions
5. **FOCUS**: Answer about the model's implementation, not general knowledge

### What This Means:
- ✅ "MAgPIE calculates yields using equation q14_yield_crop with tau factors"
- ❌ "MAgPIE accounts for climate variability in yields" (unless it actually does)
- ✅ "Module 35 applies historical disturbance rates labeled 'wildfire'"
- ❌ "MAgPIE models fire disturbance" (it doesn't - it applies fixed rates)

**Always ask yourself**: "Where is this in the code? What file and line?"

**For detailed examples, numerical example guidelines, warning signs, and quality checklist, see `core_docs/Response_Guidelines.md`**

---

## 🎯 EPISTEMIC HIERARCHY (Critical for ALL Responses)

**Every claim about MAgPIE or other models requires explicit verification status:**

- 🟢 **Verified**: Read actual code THIS session (`file.gms:123`)
- 🟡 **Documented**: Read official docs THIS session (cite source)
- 🟠 **Literature**: Published papers (cite: Author et al. YEAR)
- 🔵 **General Knowledge**: Domain knowledge about modeling/economics/ecology (NOT model-specific)
- 🔴 **Inferred**: Logical deduction from training data (lowest confidence)

**When Comparing MAgPIE to Other Models:**

⚠️ **ASYMMETRY WARNING**: You can verify MAgPIE claims (🟢 code access), but NOT other models (🔴 at best)

**Required Disclosure Pattern:**
```
"MAgPIE uses [X methodology] (🟢 verified: file.gms:123).

Other IAMs may use different approaches:
- Model Y: [claim] (🔴 inferred from training, NOT verified)

⚠️ I can only verify MAgPIE code. For authoritative comparisons, consult published comparison studies."
```

**Never present unverified claims about other models as facts.**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

**If you write any of these phrases, STOP and verify against code:**

- "MAgPIE accounts for..." (does it really?)
- "The model considers..." (verify in code)
- **"MAgPIE models X..."** → ⚠️ **CRITICAL CHECK**: Is this CALCULATED or from INPUT DATA? Is this MECHANISTIC or PARAMETERIZED?

**For parameterization vs. mechanistic modeling:**
- See `core_docs/Query_Patterns_Reference.md` Pattern 4 + Appendix
- Apply three-check verification (equation structure, parameter source, dynamic feedback)

**For complete warning signs, response checklist, and quality guidelines:**
- See `core_docs/Response_Guidelines.md`

---

## 🔄 User Feedback System

**MAgPIE developers can improve agent performance through feedback!**

- Each `module_XX.md` may have a `module_XX_notes.md` with warnings, lessons, corrections, and examples
- Always read notes files when answering about a module
- **For complete details on the feedback system, use the `/feedback` command.**

**Occasionally remind users** (sparingly):
```
📝 Spot an error or have insights to share? Use /feedback to help improve the documentation!
```

---

## 📐 DOCUMENT HIERARCHY & READING ORDER

**When answering MAgPIE questions, read in this order:**

```
User asks MAgPIE question
  → CLAUDE.md (tells you WHERE to look)
  → modules/module_XX.md (FACTS about the module)
  → module_XX_notes.md (WARNINGS/LESSONS - always check)
  → Query_Patterns_Reference.md (for complex query patterns)
  → Response_Guidelines.md (for quality/efficiency guidance)
  → cross_module/*.md (SYSTEM-LEVEL if safety/dependencies)
  → core_docs/Phase*.md (ARCHITECTURE if structural question)
  → reference/GAMS_Phase*.md (GAMS CODE if writing/debugging code)
```

**DO NOT read** (noise for MAgPIE questions):
- ❌ README.md, project/ directory (only for documentation project work)

**For complete document hierarchy, conflict resolution, and quality assurance:**
- See `core_docs/Response_Guidelines.md`

---

## ✓ QUICK RESPONSE CHECKLIST

**Before sending ANY response:**

- [ ] **🎯 CHECKED AI DOCS FIRST** (module_XX.md or core_docs/)
- [ ] **Stated documentation source** (🟡 docs / 🟢 verified in code)
- [ ] **Cited file:line** for factual claims
- [ ] **Used exact variable names** (vm_land, not "land variable")
- [ ] **Described CODE behavior only** (not ecological/economic theory)
- [ ] **If "MAgPIE models X"**: Verified parameterization vs. mechanistic (3-check)
- [ ] **Stated limitations** (what code does NOT do)

**For complete checklist (20+ items), see `core_docs/Response_Guidelines.md`**
