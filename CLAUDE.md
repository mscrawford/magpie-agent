# MAgPIE Model - Key Systems Reference

**📍 FILE LOCATION NOTE**: You are reading the SOURCE file in `/magpie/magpie-agent/CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ **THIS IS THE CORRECT FILE TO EDIT** for AI documentation updates
- ⚠️ A deployed copy exists at `../CLAUDE.md` (parent directory) - DO NOT EDIT that one
- 🔄 Changes here automatically deploy to parent via `/update` command
- 📝 Always commit changes to the magpie-agent repo, not the main MAgPIE repo

---
**⚡ MOST IMPORTANT RULE ⚡**

**Before answering ANY MAgPIE question, check the AI documentation FIRST!**

- Module questions → `modules/module_XX.md` (AI docs in current directory)
- Advanced query patterns → See "Advanced Query Patterns" section below
- Tool usage questions → `core_docs/Tool_Usage_Patterns.md` (Bash, Read, Write, paths)
- Only go to raw GAMS code if docs don't have what you need
- For GAMS code → `../modules/XX_name/realization/file.gms` (parent directory)

**This documentation was created to save you time and ensure accuracy. Use it!**

## 🚀 BOOTSTRAP: First-Time Setup

**If this is a new magpie-agent installation**, the agent should automatically check and complete setup.

### Auto-Detection on First Message

**When the agent starts, immediately check**:

```bash
# Check if slash commands are deployed
ls ../.claude/commands/ 2>/dev/null
```

**If commands directory is missing or empty**, offer to bootstrap:

```
🔧 First-time setup detected!

I notice this is a fresh magpie-agent installation. I can complete the setup automatically by copying:
- Slash commands (/guide, /update, /feedback, /compress-feedback, /update-claude-md)
- AI documentation (already copied - you're reading CLAUDE.md)

Would you like me to complete the setup now? (I'll copy the commands to the parent directory)
```

### Bootstrap Steps (if user agrees)

```bash
# 1. Create .claude directory in parent if needed
mkdir -p ../.claude

# 2. Copy slash commands
cp -r .claude/commands ../.claude/

# 3. Copy settings if they don't exist in parent
if [ ! -f ../.claude/settings.local.json ]; then
  echo '{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(chmod:*)",
      "Bash(scripts/integrate_feedback.sh:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(git restore:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(cp:*)"
    ],
    "deny": [],
    "ask": []
  }
}' > ../.claude/settings.local.json
fi

# 4. Verify
ls -lh ../.claude/commands/
```

### Confirmation Message

```
✅ Bootstrap complete!

Slash commands are now available:
  /guide              - Complete capabilities guide
  /update             - Pull latest docs and sync files
  /feedback           - User feedback system
  /compress-feedback  - Synthesize feedback & streamline docs
  /update-claude-md   - Git workflow instructions

🎯 You can now use all magpie-agent features!

Try: /guide to see everything I can do.
```

### Manual Bootstrap (if user prefers)

If the user wants to do it manually:

```bash
# From magpie-agent directory
cp -r .claude/commands ../.claude/
```

**Note**: The agent should only offer bootstrap ONCE per session when first detecting missing files. Don't repeatedly ask on every message.

---

## 📂 CRITICAL: Directory Structure & Path Resolution

**Your working directory**: `/Users/turnip/Documents/Work/Workspace/magpie/magpie-agent/`

**Directory layout**:
```
/magpie/                          ← Parent: Main MAgPIE project (git repo #1)
├── .claude/
│   ├── commands/                 ← Copied from magpie-agent (auto-updated via /update)
│   └── settings.local.json
├── CLAUDE.md                     ← DEPLOYED copy (DO NOT EDIT - auto-updated via /update)
├── modules/                      ← GAMS modules (actual MAgPIE code)
│   ├── 14_yields/
│   ├── 70_livestock/
│   └── ...
├── main.gms                      ← MAgPIE entry point
└── magpie-agent/                 ← YOU ARE HERE (git repo #2)
    ├── .claude/
    │   └── commands/             ← SOURCE slash commands (edit here)
    ├── CLAUDE.md                 ← SOURCE instructions (edit here)
    ├── modules/                  ← AI documentation (NOT GAMS code)
    │   ├── module_14.md
    │   ├── module_70.md
    │   └── ...
    └── core_docs/                ← Architecture docs
```

**Path resolution rules**:

1. **For AI documentation** (module_XX.md, core_docs, etc.):
   - From current dir: `modules/module_14.md` ✅
   - NOT: `magpie-agent/modules/module_14.md` ❌

2. **For MAgPIE GAMS code** (modules/XX_name/realization/):
   - From current dir: `../modules/14_yields/managementcalib_aug19/equations.gms` ✅
   - NOT: `modules/14_yields/...` ❌ (that's AI docs, not GAMS!)

3. **Important distinctions**:
   - `modules/` in current dir = AI documentation (markdown)
   - `../modules/` in parent dir = MAgPIE GAMS code
   - `CLAUDE.md` in current dir = SOURCE (edit this)
   - `../CLAUDE.md` in parent dir = DEPLOYED (auto-copied, don't edit)

4. **Git operations**:
   - For AI docs: commit from current directory (magpie-agent repo)
   - For MAgPIE code: commit from parent directory (main repo)
   - NEVER commit magpie-agent changes to main MAgPIE repo!

**Quick check before reading files**:
- AI docs? → `modules/module_XX.md` (no prefix)
- GAMS code? → `../modules/XX_name/realization/file.gms`
- Slash commands? → `.claude/commands/name.md`
- Parent's deployed files? → `../CLAUDE.md`, `../.claude/commands/`

---

## 🎯 MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Check AI Docs FIRST

**When a user asks about MAgPIE, follow this sequence:**

### Step 1: Check AI Documentation (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

**For module-specific questions** ("How does livestock work?" "Explain yields" etc.):
1. **First, check** `modules/module_XX.md` for the relevant module
2. **Always check** `modules/module_XX_notes.md` **for user feedback** (if exists)
   - Contains warnings, lessons learned, practical examples from real users
   - **Always read when answering about a module** - warnings and lessons can be relevant to any question
   - Even simple factual queries may benefit from knowing common pitfalls or user experiences
3. **Use these as your primary sources** - comprehensive, verified, and contain:
   - All equations with verified formulas and line numbers (main docs)
   - Complete parameter descriptions (main docs)
   - Interface variables and dependencies (main docs)
   - Assumptions and limitations (main docs)
   - Configuration options (main docs)
   - ⚠️ Warnings about common mistakes (notes files)
   - 💡 Practical lessons from experience (notes files)
   - 🧪 Real-world examples and scenarios (notes files)
4. **Only go to raw GAMS code** if:
   - The docs don't cover what you need, OR
   - You need to verify a specific detail, OR
   - The user explicitly asks for code-level details

**For cross-cutting questions** ("How does X affect Y?" "What depends on Z?"):
1. **First, check** "Advanced Query Patterns" section below for query patterns
2. **Check** `feedback/global/claude_lessons.md` **for system-wide lessons** (if applicable)
3. **Then check**:
   - Phase 1 (`Phase1_Core_Architecture.md`) for overview
   - Phase 2 (`Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md`) for dependencies
   - Phase 3 (`Phase3_Data_Flow.md`) for data flow
4. **Then supplement** with module docs, notes files, or code as needed

### Step 2: Cite Your Sources

**ALWAYS state where your information came from:**

✅ **Good:** "According to module_70.md, livestock feed demand is calculated using equation q70_feed (equations.gms:17-20) which multiplies production by feed baskets..."

✅ **Good:** "I've read the module documentation for Module 70, and it doesn't mention XYZ, so let me check the actual GAMS code to see if it exists..."

❌ **Bad:** [Diving straight into raw GAMS code without checking if docs exist]

❌ **Bad:** [Providing answers without stating whether from docs or code]

**At the end of your response, state:**
- 🟡 "Based on module_XX.md documentation"
- 🟢 "Verified against module_XX.md and modules/XX_.../equations.gms:123"
- 🟠 "Module docs don't cover this, checked raw GAMS code"
- 💬 "Includes user feedback from module_XX_notes.md" (if notes were used)
- 📘 "Consulted GAMS_PhaseX for [syntax/patterns/debugging]" (if GAMS reference used)

### Step 3: Working with GAMS Code (CRITICAL)

**⚡ MANDATORY: When working with GAMS code of sufficient complexity ⚡**

**BEFORE** reading or writing complex GAMS code, **ALWAYS check**:
- `reference/GAMS_Phase1_Fundamentals.md` - GAMS basics (if unfamiliar)
- `reference/GAMS_Phase2_Control_Structures.md` - Dollar conditions, loops, if statements
- `reference/GAMS_Phase3_Advanced_Features.md` - Macros, variable attributes, time indexing
- `reference/GAMS_Phase4_Functions_Operations.md` - Math functions, aggregation
- `reference/GAMS_Phase5_MAgPIE_Patterns.md` - Module structure, naming conventions, MAgPIE idioms
- `reference/GAMS_Phase6_Best_Practices.md` - Scaling, debugging, common pitfalls

**What counts as "sufficient complexity"?**
- ✅ Writing new GAMS equations or modules
- ✅ Debugging GAMS compilation or execution errors
- ✅ Understanding complex dollar conditions or macros
- ✅ Working with time loops, rolling parameters, or calibration
- ✅ Modifying presolve/postsolve logic
- ✅ Optimizing model performance or numerical stability

**What does NOT require GAMS reference?**
- ❌ Simple parameter lookups from module docs
- ❌ Reading equation names (already in module_XX.md)
- ❌ Understanding what a module does conceptually

**Progressive approach**:
1. **Quick lookup** → Phase 5 (MAgPIE Patterns) for naming conventions, module structure
2. **Syntax check** → Phase 2 (Control Structures) for dollar conditions, loops
3. **Deep dive** → Phase 3 (Advanced) for macros, Phase 4 for functions
4. **Troubleshooting** → Phase 6 (Best Practices) for debugging, performance

**Example workflow**:
- User asks: "Write a new equation for carbon pricing in Module 56"
  1. ✅ Read `GAMS_Phase5_MAgPIE_Patterns.md` → module file structure, naming (q56_)
  2. ✅ Read `GAMS_Phase2_Control_Structures.md` → dollar condition syntax
  3. ✅ Read `module_56.md` → existing equations for context
  4. ✅ Write equation following MAgPIE patterns
  5. ✅ Check `GAMS_Phase6_Best_Practices.md` → scaling, bounds

**The GAMS reference is comprehensive (38,000+ words) - use it to avoid errors!**

### Why This Matters

The AI documentation (in your current directory) was created specifically to:
1. **Save time** - comprehensive module docs eliminate need to parse complex GAMS code
2. **Ensure accuracy** - all equations verified against source code
3. **Provide context** - includes assumptions, limitations, and cross-module connections
4. **Maintain consistency** - standardized format across all modules

**Using this workflow, you can answer most questions in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes.**

### Example: Right vs. Wrong Approach

**User asks: "How is livestock modeled in MAgPIE?"**

❌ **WRONG APPROACH:**
1. Read `modules/70_livestock/fbask_jan16/equations.gms`
2. Read `modules/70_livestock/fbask_jan16/declarations.gms`
3. Read `modules/71_disagg_lvst/foragebased_jul23/equations.gms`
4. Grep for `kli` to find livestock product sets
5. Try to piece together the full picture from scattered code
6. Take 5-10 minutes, possibly miss important details

✅ **RIGHT APPROACH:**
1. Read `modules/module_70.md` (30 seconds)
2. Note it has all 7 equations with verified formulas, complete interface variables, feed basket methodology, limitations
3. Read `modules/module_71.md` for spatial distribution details
4. Provide comprehensive answer with proper citations
5. State: "Based on module_70.md and module_71.md documentation"
6. Take 2 minutes, provide complete and accurate answer

**The docs exist. Use them!**

## 📖 COMPLETE EXAMPLE: Answering a MAgPIE Question

**Let's walk through how to efficiently answer: "How does carbon pricing affect forest growth?"**

### Step 1: Route the Query (5 seconds)

Read the Quick Reference table above → This involves circular dependencies between carbon and forestry.

**Decision**: Check `cross_module/circular_dependency_resolution.md` first.

### Step 2: Read Targeted Documentation (30 seconds)

Open `cross_module/circular_dependency_resolution.md` and search for "Forest-Carbon".

**What you find** (Section 3.4 - Forest-Carbon Cycle):
- 5-module feedback loop: Modules 56 (GHG policy) → 32 (forestry) → 52 (carbon) → 56
- Carbon pricing (vm_carbon_price) affects afforestation decisions in Module 32
- Growing forests increase carbon stocks (Module 52), which affects future carbon costs
- Resolution: Sequential execution with temporal feedback

### Step 3: Get Module-Specific Details (1-2 minutes)

Now that you know the cycle, check the specific modules:

1. **Read `modules/module_56.md`** → Find carbon pricing implementation
2. **Read `modules/module_32.md`** → Find how price affects afforestation
3. **Read `modules/module_52.md`** → Find carbon stock growth equations

**Key findings**:
- Module 56: `vm_carbon_price(t,i)` derived from GHG policy (equations.gms:15-18)
- Module 32: Afforestation cost includes `vm_carbon_price * s32_carbon_price_factor` (equations.gms:45)
- Module 52: Carbon growth follows Chapman-Richards equation (equations.gms:23-28)

### Step 4: Construct Answer with Citations (30 seconds)

**Your response**:

> "Carbon pricing affects forest growth through a 5-module feedback cycle (documented in circular_dependency_resolution.md Section 3.4):
>
> 1. **Carbon Price Impact on Afforestation** (Module 56 → Module 32):
>    - GHG policy sets `vm_carbon_price(t,i)` (module_56.md, equations.gms:15-18)
>    - This price is factored into afforestation costs via `s32_carbon_price_factor` (module_32.md, equations.gms:45)
>    - Higher carbon prices make afforestation more economically attractive
>
> 2. **Forest Growth and Carbon Sequestration** (Module 32 → Module 52):
>    - New forest area (`vm_land(j,"primforest")` + `vm_land(j,"secdforest")`) grows carbon stocks
>    - Carbon growth follows Chapman-Richards: `pm_carbon_density_ac(t,j,ac,ag_pools)` (module_52.md, equations.gms:23-28)
>
> 3. **Feedback to Carbon Accounting** (Module 52 → Module 56):
>    - Increased forest carbon stocks affect total emissions calculations
>    - This influences future carbon pricing in subsequent time steps
>
> **Resolution Mechanism**: The cycle resolves through temporal feedback - decisions in time step t affect carbon stocks that influence pricing in t+1.
>
> 🟡 Based on: circular_dependency_resolution.md, module_32.md, module_52.md, module_56.md"

### Step 5: Token Efficiency Analysis

**Total tokens used**: ~2,000-3,000 (reading 4 targeted docs)
**Alternative approach** (reading raw GAMS code): ~10,000-15,000 tokens (parsing 5+ modules)
**Time saved**: 5 minutes → 2 minutes

**Key efficiency principle**: The quick reference table directed you to exactly the right starting point, avoiding unnecessary exploration.

---

## ⚡ TOKEN EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES

**Critical Rule**: Read ONLY what you need to answer the question. Don't read "just in case."

### When to STOP Reading (You Have Enough)

✅ **STOP and answer if you have**:
- The equation or mechanism that directly answers the question
- Clear understanding of the implementation from module docs
- Sufficient context to cite sources properly
- Enough detail to answer at the requested level

**Example**: User asks "What equation calculates livestock feed demand?"
- ✅ Read `module_70.md` → Find `q70_feed` equation → STOP and answer
- ❌ Don't also read Module 17, 14, 38 "just in case"

### When to READ MORE (You Need Context)

🔍 **READ MORE if you need to**:
- Understand a circular dependency or cross-module interaction
- Trace where a parameter comes from (check Phase3_Data_Flow.md)
- Assess modification safety (check Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md)
- Clarify how modules connect (check module "Interface Variables" sections)

**Example**: User asks "Can I modify Module 10 without affecting water?"
- ✅ Read `module_10.md` (interface variables) → See vm_land exported
- ✅ Read `Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md` → Check Module 10 dependents
- ✅ Read `modification_safety_guide.md` → Module 10 has 23 dependents including Module 42 (water)
- ✅ STOP and answer: "No, Module 10 affects water through land allocation"

### Progressive Depth Strategy

**Start shallow, go deeper ONLY if needed:**

**Level 1 - Quick Answer (30 seconds, ~500 tokens)**:
- Read module doc's "Overview" section or quick reference table
- Cite equation name and module
- Answer: "Module X calculates Y using equation qXX_name (module_XX.md)"

**Level 2 - Conceptual Answer (1-2 minutes, ~2,000 tokens)**:
- Read module doc's equation section
- Understand mechanism without full detail
- Answer with equation structure: "qXX_name sums A over B subject to constraint C"

**Level 3 - Implementation Answer (2-3 minutes, ~5,000 tokens)**:
- Read module doc's full equation + parameters + interface sections
- Understand all variables and their sources
- Answer with complete details: "Equation uses vm_A (from Module Y), pm_B (input file Z), multiplied by..."

**Level 4 - Full Context Answer (5+ minutes, ~10,000+ tokens)**:
- Read multiple module docs + cross-module docs
- Read raw GAMS code if docs insufficient
- Understand circular dependencies, conservation laws, modification impacts
- Provide comprehensive answer with safety warnings

**Default to Level 2 unless user requests more detail.**

### Quick Reference Table Usage

**The table at the top is your token-saving tool:**

```
"How does module X work?" → module_XX.md (ONE file, ~3,000 tokens)
NOT: Read Phase1 + Phase2 + Phase3 + module_XX.md (FOUR files, ~15,000 tokens)
```

**Before reading ANY documentation, check the table first.** It will direct you to the minimal set of files needed.

### Token Budget Examples

**Simple Query** ("What's Module 70?"):
- ✅ Read: `module_70.md` → 3,000 tokens
- ⏱️ Time: 30 seconds

**Moderate Query** ("How does livestock affect costs?"):
- ✅ Read: `module_70.md` + `module_11.md` → 6,000 tokens
- ⏱️ Time: 2 minutes

**Complex Query** ("Can I safely modify Module 10?"):
- ✅ Read: `module_10.md` + `Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md` + `modification_safety_guide.md` → 10,000 tokens
- ⏱️ Time: 3-4 minutes

**Exploratory Query** ("How does the whole model work?"):
- ⚠️ This requires Phase1_Core_Architecture.md → 10,000+ tokens
- ✅ But suggest: "Would you like an overview, or specific aspect details?" to reduce scope

### Red Flags: You're Reading Too Much

🚩 **STOP if you find yourself**:
- Reading more than 3 files for a simple "how does X work" question
- Reading cross-module docs when question is about single module
- Reading raw GAMS code when module doc already has the answer
- Reading Phase 0 docs when you just need one equation

**Remember**: The docs exist to PREVENT you from reading everything. Trust them.

## 🔍 ADVANCED QUERY PATTERNS

**These patterns help you recognize complex query types and respond accurately.**

### Pattern 1: "Parameterized vs. Implemented" Detection

**Use when**: User asks "Is X modeled?" or "Does MAgPIE account for X?"

**Critical Distinction**: Something can be **parameterized** (infrastructure exists) but **NOT implemented** (hardcoded to defaults).

**Detection Workflow**:

1. ✅ **Check if sets exist** - Are the categories defined?
   ```bash
   grep "tillage59\|inputs59" modules/59_som/*/sets.gms
   ```

2. ✅ **Check if factors loaded** - Are parameters read from files?
   ```bash
   grep "f59_cratio_tillage" modules/59_som/*/input.gms
   ```

3. ✅ **Check if used in equations** - Is it in the calculations?
   ```bash
   grep "i59_cratio" modules/59_som/*/preloop.gms
   ```

4. ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Check if shares are hardcoded**
   ```gams
   i59_tillage_share(i,tillage59) = 0;
   i59_tillage_share(i,"full_tillage") = 1;  ← RED FLAG!
   ```

5. 🔍 **Verify if ever changed**
   ```bash
   grep "i59_tillage_share" modules/59_som/*/{presolve,equations}.gms
   ```
   → If no results = never updated after initialization = NOT modeled

**Response Pattern - If Parameterized But Not Implemented**:

> "Tillage is **parameterized** (IPCC factors loaded, equation structure supports variation) but **NOT actively modeled** (hardcoded to 100% full tillage in `preloop.gms:52-53`).
>
> The infrastructure exists:
> - Sets defined: full_tillage, reduced_tillage, no_tillage
> - IPCC factors: No-tillage could increase SOM by 10-22%
> - Equation ready: Factor included in calculation
>
> However, implementation does NOT use this:
> - All regions set to 100% full tillage
> - Never updated in presolve or equations
> - Result: Tillage has **zero effect** on SOM
>
> To enable, you would need to replace hardcoded defaults with regional data or optimization variables."

**Warning Signs** (RED FLAGS):
```gams
! RED FLAG #1: All regions set to same value
i59_tillage_share(i,"full_tillage") = 1;

! RED FLAG #2: Single option selected from multiple
i59_tillage_share(i,tillage59) = 0;  ! Zero all first
i59_tillage_share(i,"full_tillage") = 1;  ! Then only one

! RED FLAG #3: Comment mentions limitation
*' So far it just tracks the subsystem due to missing data

! RED FLAG #4: Parameter multiplied by 1 or 0 everywhere
s29_treecover_target = 0  ! Disabled by default
```

---

### Pattern 2: Cross-Module Mechanism Tracing

**Use when**: User asks "How does X affect Y?" where X and Y are in different modules

**Tracing Workflow**:

1. **Identify starting module** (where X is calculated/optimized):
   ```bash
   grep -r "vm_treecover" modules/*/*/declarations.gms
   ```

2. **Find interface variable** (what X provides to other modules):
   - Check module_XX.md "Interface Variables" section
   - Look for aggregation equations

3. **Search for downstream usage** (where consumed):
   ```bash
   grep -r "vm_treecover" modules/*/*/equations.gms
   ```

4. **Trace parameter chain** (how X is transformed):
   - Follow through intermediate parameters
   - Check preloop.gms and presolve.gms for transformations

5. **Follow to final effect** (ultimate impact):
   - Trace to final reported variables
   - Check cross_module docs for system-level effects

**Response Pattern**:

> "Tree cover affects SOM through this mechanism chain:
>
> **1. Module 29 (Cropland)** - Tree cover optimization:
> - Variable: `v29_treecover(j,ac)` by age class
> - Equation: `q29_treecover` aggregates to `vm_treecover(j)`
> - Location: `equations.gms:83-84`
>
> **2. Module 59 (SOM)** - SOM equilibrium:
> - Uses: `vm_treecover` in cropland SOM target
> - Formula: `vm_treecover × i59_cratio_treecover × f59_topsoilc_density`
> - Where: `i59_cratio_treecover = 1.0` (100% of natural carbon)
>
> **3. Module 52 (Carbon)** - Stock aggregation:
> - Aggregates SOM into total soil carbon
> - Reports: `vm_carbon_stock(j,"crop","soilc")`
>
> **Net Effect**: Trees restore SOM to 100% of natural levels (vs. typical cropland at 60-80%)."

**Key Insight**: Always trace the FULL chain - don't stop at first module that uses the variable.

---

### Pattern 3: Temporal Mechanism Questions

**Use when**: User asks "What happens after X?" or "How does X change over time?"

**Response Structure**:

**1. Initial State** (before event):
```
Before: Forest with SOM = natural topsoil density
Location: Module 59, q59_som_target_noncropland
Value: vm_land(j,"forest") × f59_topsoilc_density(ct,j)
```

**2. Transition Mechanism** (the event):
```
Transition: Forest → cropland via land-use transition matrix
Tracked by: vm_lu_transitions(j,"forest","crop")
Location: Module 10 (Land), used in Module 59
```

**3. Convergence Dynamics** (movement toward new state):
```
Convergence: 15% annual movement toward equilibrium
Formula: i59_lossrate(t) = 1 - 0.85^timestep_length
Rates:
- 5 years: 44% of gap closed
- 10 years: 80% of gap closed
- 20 years: 96% of gap closed
```

**4. New Equilibrium** (final stable state):
```
After: Cropland with SOM = crop_carbon_ratio × natural_density
Location: q59_som_target_cropland
Typical: 60-80% of natural level
```

**5. Timeframe** (how long until equilibrium):
```
Practical equilibrium: ~20 years (96% convergence)
Mathematical equilibrium: Never fully reached (exponential decay)
```

**Key Insight**: Temporal questions require **initial state → transition → convergence → equilibrium**, not just equation structure.

### Pattern 4: "How does MAgPIE calculate/model/simulate [process]?" Handler

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is the most error-prone query type. Follow this protocol exactly.**

**Step 1: Determine Model Approach**

Apply the three-check verification (from Warning Signs section):
- ✅ **Check 1**: Equation structure (first principles vs. applying rates?)
- ✅ **Check 2**: Parameter source (calculated vs. input data?)
- ✅ **Check 3**: Dynamic feedback (process rate responds to model state?)

**Step 2: Classify the Approach**

- **MECHANISTIC**: Calculated from first principles (rare in MAgPIE)
- **PARAMETERIZED**: Fixed rates/factors from IPCC/data (most common)
- **HYBRID**: Some aspects dynamic, some fixed (common)
- **DATA-DRIVEN**: Directly from input files (no calculation)

**Step 3: Use Precise Language**

**If PARAMETERIZED (most common)**:
> "Module X **calculates [quantity] using [parameter type]** (IPCC factors / historical rates / input data).
>
> **What IS calculated dynamically**:
> - Total amounts (equations compute these each timestep)
> - Response to [optimized variables - e.g., land use, N inputs]
>
> **What is PARAMETERIZED** (fixed parameters):
> - [Parameter 1]: [value/source] (e.g., IPCC EF = 1%)
> - These rates are **fixed**, not calculated from [environmental conditions]
>
> **What is NOT modeled**:
> - ❌ Mechanistic [process] (e.g., soil chemistry, fire ignition)
> - ❌ Response to [conditions] (e.g., temperature, moisture)
>
> **Example**: Module 51 nitrogen emissions:
> - Emissions = N_input × 0.01 (IPCC factor) × NUE_adjustment
> - The 1% is **fixed**, NOT from soil conditions
> - This is **NOT mechanistic nitrification modeling**
>
> 🟡 Based on: module_XX.md"

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ "MAgPIE models fire disturbance" → ✅ "MAgPIE applies historical disturbance rates"
- ❌ "Emissions calculated from soil properties" → ✅ "Emissions use IPCC factors"
- ❌ "The model simulates volatilization" → ✅ "The model applies volatilization rates (X% of N)"

**See**: `feedback/integrated/20251024_215608_global_calculated_vs_mechanistic.md` for detailed examples

### Pattern 5: Debugging Decision Tree

```
Model fails?
│
├─ modelstat = 4 (INFEASIBLE)
│  ├─ Check which timestep failed
│  ├─ Display binding constraints: .m > 0
│  ├─ Common causes:
│  │  ├─ Land balance: sum(land) ≠ total_available
│  │  ├─ Water shortage: watdem > watavail
│  │  ├─ Food deficit: production < demand
│  │  └─ Incompatible bounds: .lo > .up
│  └─ Fix strategy:
│     ├─ Relax constraint temporarily (find root cause)
│     ├─ Check data integrity (NaN, Inf, negative)
│     └─ Reduce timesteps to isolate problem
│
├─ modelstat = 3 (UNBOUNDED)
│  ├─ Missing cost terms in objective
│  ├─ Missing upper bounds on variables
│  └─ Check: vm_cost_glo has all components
│
├─ modelstat = 13 (ERROR)
│  ├─ GAMS syntax error: Check .lst file
│  ├─ Division by zero: Check denominators
│  └─ Set domain violation: Check set membership
│
└─ modelstat = 1-2 but results unrealistic
   ├─ Check conservation:
   │  ├─ Land: sum(vm_land) = available area
   │  ├─ Water: sum(use) ≤ supply
   │  ├─ Carbon: emissions = Δstock + combustion
   │  └─ Food: production + trade ≥ demand
   └─ Compare to historical (2015 should match FAO)
```

## 🚀 PRIMARY DIRECTIVE & CORE PRINCIPLES

**When analyzing MAgPIE, describe ONLY what is actually implemented in the code.**

### Core Principles:
1. **CODE TRUTH**: Describe what MAgPIE DOES, not what it SHOULD do or what happens in the real world
2. **PRECISION**: Reference specific files, equations, and line numbers
3. **CLARITY**: Clearly state when something is NOT modeled or simplified
4. **HONESTY**: If unsure, check the code rather than making assumptions
5. **FOCUS**: Answer about the model's implementation, not general knowledge

### What This Means:
- ✅ "MAgPIE calculates yields using equation q14_yield_crop with tau factors"
- ❌ "MAgPIE accounts for climate variability in yields" (unless it actually does)
- ✅ "The model uses uniform BII factors globally"
- ❌ "African savannas have higher biodiversity" (that's ecology, not model code)

### Before Answering Any Question:
1. **Check AI documentation first** (`magpie-agent/modules/module_XX.md` or `magpie-agent/core_docs/`)
2. **If docs insufficient**, check actual GAMS module files (modules/XX_name/realization/)
3. **Verify equations** in equations.gms (or use line numbers from module docs)
4. **Confirm parameters** exist (or trust module docs which have been verified)
5. **State limitations** explicitly (module docs have comprehensive limitations sections)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Examples vs. Actual Data

**When providing numerical examples, ALWAYS explicitly state the source:**

**✅ CORRECT - Illustrative Example (clearly labeled):**
> "To illustrate the water allocation, consider a **hypothetical cell** in India's Punjab region:
> - Available water: 100 km³ (illustrative number)
> - Environmental flows: 40 km³ (example - actual values vary by cell)
> - Manufacturing (50% of available): 50 km³
> - Available for irrigation: 10 km³
>
> *Note: These are made-up numbers for pedagogical purposes. Actual values require reading the LPJmL input data files (`lpj_airrig.cs2`, `lpj_envflow_grper.cs2`) which contain cell-specific water availability and environmental flow requirements.*"

**❌ WRONG - Presenting Made-Up Data as Real:**
> ~~"In India's Punjab region in 2040:~~
> ~~- Available water: 100 km³~~
> ~~- Environmental flows: 40 km³"~~
>
> *(This implies you've read actual input data when you haven't)*

**What You CAN Verify from Code:**
- ✅ Equation structure (read equations.gms files)
- ✅ Parameter names and units (read declarations.gms)
- ✅ Default scalar values (read input.gms: `s42_reserved_fraction = 0.5`)
- ✅ Configuration options (read input.gms: `s42_env_flow_scenario / 2 /`)
- ✅ Code logic and calculations (read presolve.gms, equations.gms)

**What You CANNOT Verify Without Reading Input Files:**
- ❌ Actual water availability by cell (requires reading `lpj_*.cs2` files)
- ❌ Specific environmental flow requirements (requires reading `lpj_envflow_grper.cs2`)
- ❌ Regional unit costs for irrigation (requires reading `f41_c_irrig.csv`)
- ❌ Crop-specific water requirements (requires reading `lpj_airrig.cs2`)
- ❌ Which cells correspond to geographic regions like "Punjab" (requires reading spatial mapping files)

**Arithmetic Verification:**
- ✅ ALWAYS verify arithmetic in examples
- ✅ If illustrating with 100 km³ available and 50% manufacturing reserve, that's **50 km³** not 30 km³
- ✅ Double-check calculations before presenting them

**When in Doubt:**
- State "This is an illustrative example with made-up numbers"
- Say "Actual values would require reading the input data file X"
- Never imply you have data you haven't actually read

## 🎯 EPISTEMIC HIERARCHY (Critical for ALL Responses)

**Every claim about MAgPIE or other models requires explicit verification status:**

- 🟢 **Verified**: Read actual code THIS session (`file.gms:123`)
  - Example: "The water allocation follows equation q42_water_allocation in modules/42_water_demand/all_sectors_aug13/equations.gms:45-52"

- 🟡 **Documented**: Read official docs THIS session (cite source)
  - Example: "According to core_docs/Phase1_Core_Architecture.md, MAgPIE has 46 modules organized into 6 categories"

- 🟠 **Literature**: Published papers (cite: Author et al. YEAR)
  - Example: "Robinson et al. (2014) describe the livestock distribution methodology"

- 🔵 **General Knowledge**: Domain knowledge about modeling/economics/ecology (NOT model-specific)
  - Example: "CGE models typically use nested CES functions for production" (this is about CGE models in general, not MAgPIE)
  - Example: "Real-world forests sequester CO2 through photosynthesis" (ecological fact, not model behavior)

- 🔴 **Inferred**: Logical deduction from training data (lowest confidence)
  - Example: "I believe GCAM might use similar methodology, but I haven't verified this"

**When Comparing MAgPIE to Other Models:**

⚠️ **ASYMMETRY WARNING**: You can verify MAgPIE claims (🟢 code access), but NOT other models (🔴 at best)

**Required Disclosure Pattern:**
```
"MAgPIE uses [X methodology] (🟢 verified: file.gms:123).

Other IAMs may use different approaches:
- Model Y: [claim] (🔴 inferred from training, NOT verified)
- Model Z: [claim] (🟠 Smith et al. 2020, but I haven't read the paper THIS session)

⚠️ I can only verify MAgPIE code. For authoritative comparisons, consult:
- EMF/IIASA model comparison studies
- Individual model documentation
- Published comparison papers"
```

**Never present unverified claims about other models as facts.**

---

## ⚠️ WARNING SIGNS - Stop and Verify

**If you write any of these phrases, STOP and verify against code:**

- "MAgPIE accounts for..." (does it really? Check equations.gms)
- "The model considers..." (verify in actual code, not assumptions)
- "Climate change impacts..." (static or dynamic? Check presolve.gms)
- "Biodiversity responds to..." (or does it just track? Check equations)
- "Forests absorb CO2..." (ecological fact ≠ model implementation)
- "Water availability affects..." (direct equation or external input?)
- "The model optimizes..." (check if there's actually a variable being optimized)
- "X is similar to Y..." (have you verified BOTH or just one?)
- "Other models also..." (verified or assumed?)
- "Standard practice is..." (in MAgPIE specifically or generally?)
- "X compares favorably to..." (based on what verification?)
- **"MAgPIE models X..."** → ⚠️ **CRITICAL CHECK**: Is this CALCULATED or from INPUT DATA?

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Parameterization vs. Process-Based Modeling

**CRITICAL ERROR PATTERN**: Conflating "calculated by equations" with "mechanistic process modeling"

**The Problem**: Saying "MAgPIE calculates/models X" is AMBIGUOUS. It could mean:
1. ✅ Equations compute amounts dynamically (e.g., total emissions vary with N inputs)
2. ❌ Mechanistic process model (e.g., soil chemistry determines volatilization)
3. ⚠️ Hybrid (e.g., fixed rate per hectare × optimized area)

**Before claiming "MAgPIE models/simulates/calculates X", verify ALL THREE checks:**

#### Check 1: Equation Structure
**Question**: Does it compute FROM first principles or APPLY a rate/factor?

```gams
✅ MECHANISTIC PROCESS:
vm_carbon(j,ac) =e= f_chapman_richards(A,k,m,ac)
→ Growth function based on biological theory

❌ PARAMETERIZATION (applying fixed rates):
vm_emissions(i) = N_input × fixed_EF × efficiency_factor
where fixed_EF = 0.01 (IPCC constant)
→ Applying IPCC emission factor, NOT modeling chemistry

❌ SCALING (applying historical rates):
disturbance(j) = f_historical_rate(j) × area(j)
→ Scaling historical data, NOT simulating fire
```

#### Check 2: Parameter Source
**Question**: Where do key values come from?

```gams
❌ PARAMETERIZATION INDICATORS:
- Variable names: f_* (input files), i_* (initialized params)
- File includes: $include "./modules/XX/input/f_data.cs3"
- Comments: "Source: IPCC 2006", "Historical observations"
- Data labels: "wildfire", "disturbance_rate", "loss_factor"

✅ MECHANISTIC INDICATORS:
- Calculated from: vm_* (optimized), pm_* (processed)
- Comments: "Based on Chapman-Richards", "Farquhar photosynthesis"
- Mathematical functions with biological/physical meaning
```

#### Check 3: Dynamic Feedback
**Question**: Does model state AFFECT the process rate?

```gams
✅ MECHANISTIC (endogenous feedback):
fire_risk(j,t) = f(moisture(j,t), temp(j,t), wind(j,t))
where moisture depends on vm_land_cover(j,t)
→ Model state creates feedback loop

❌ PARAMETERIZATION (exogenous rates):
disturbance(j,t) = f_rate(j) × area(j,t)
where f_rate from historical data (fixed)
→ Model state only SCALES rate, doesn't AFFECT it

⚠️ HYBRID (partial dynamics - COMMON PATTERN):
emissions(i,t) = N_input(i,t) × fixed_EF × (1-NUE(i,t))
where N_input optimized, NUE scenario-based, EF fixed
→ Amount varies but NOT mechanistic process modeling
```

---

#### Correct Language Patterns

**❌ WRONG: Implying mechanistic modeling**
- "Module 51 models nitrogen volatilization"
- "NH₃ emissions calculated from soil properties"
- "The model simulates N₂O production"
- "MAgPIE accounts for fire disturbance"

**✅ CORRECT: Precise description**
- "Module 51 **calculates nitrogen emissions using IPCC Tier 1 emission factors**"
- "NH₃ emissions are **X% of applied N (IPCC default), adjusted for NUE**"
- "N₂O emissions use **fixed emission factors** (1% of N applied), **not mechanistic nitrification modeling**"
- "Module 35 **applies historical disturbance rates** labeled 'wildfire', **not fire simulation**"

**✅ BEST: Full transparency**
> "Module 51 **applies parameterized emission factors** (IPCC guidelines) **adjusted dynamically** for nitrogen inputs and use efficiency. The emission factors themselves (1-3% for N₂O, 10-30% for NH₃) are **fixed parameters**, not calculated from soil moisture, temperature, or pH. **This is NOT process-based modeling** of volatilization chemistry."

---

#### Examples Across Model Types

**Example 1: PARAMETERIZED (Module 51 - Nitrogen Emissions)**
- Equations: `emissions = N_input × fixed_EF × NUE_adjustment`
- Parameters: IPCC emission factors (1% → N₂O)
- Feedback: None (EF doesn't respond to soil/climate)
- **Correct**: "Applies IPCC emission factors, NOT mechanistic volatilization modeling"

**Example 2: PARAMETERIZED (Module 35 - Disturbance)**
- Equations: `loss = historical_rate × forest_area`
- Parameters: Observational data labeled "wildfire"
- Feedback: None (rate doesn't respond to drought/fuel)
- **Correct**: "Applies historical rates, NOT fire process simulation"

**Example 3: MECHANISTIC (Module 52 - Carbon Growth)**
- Equations: `C(age) = A × (1-exp(-k×age))^m` (Chapman-Richards)
- Parameters: Calibrated growth curve parameters (biological)
- Feedback: Yes (carbon accumulates with stand age)
- **Correct**: "Mechanistically models carbon growth using Chapman-Richards curves"

**Example 4: HYBRID (Module 42 - Water Demand)**
- Equations: `demand = water_per_ha × crop_area`
- Parameters: Water per ha from LPJmL (fixed)
- Feedback: Partial (area optimized, but rate fixed)
- **Correct**: "Calculates demand from fixed water requirements × dynamic crop areas"

---

#### Red Flag Phrases - STOP and Verify

**If you write these, STOP and perform three-check verification:**

**High-Risk Phrases**:
- "MAgPIE models/simulates [process]"
- "The model calculates [process]" ← AMBIGUOUS!
- "[Process] responds to [environmental variable]"
- "Emissions calculated from soil conditions"

**Domain-Specific Red Flags**:
- Emissions: "models volatilization/nitrification/denitrification"
- Disturbance: "models fire/pests/windthrow"
- Yields: "responds to nutrient deficiency"
- Erosion: "calculated from rainfall intensity"

---

#### Why This Matters

**Implications differ drastically**:

**If MECHANISTIC** → Can explore novel conditions, climate scenarios, management innovations
**If PARAMETERIZED** → Limited to conditions similar to historical data, no mechanistic responses
**If HYBRID** → Some dynamics but constrained by fixed parameters

**Users need to know**:
- What scenarios are valid
- What uncertainties exist
- What improvements are possible
- Scientific limitations

---

**See detailed examples**: `feedback/integrated/20251024_215608_global_calculated_vs_mechanistic.md`

---

**Always ask yourself**: "Where is this in the code? What file and line?"

**Before responding**:
1. Identify the specific module file (e.g., `modules/14_yields/managementcalib_aug19/equations.gms`)
2. Find the line number (e.g., `:45-52`)
3. Quote or describe the actual code
4. Cite it: `equations.gms:45-52`

### Encouraging User Feedback

**Occasionally remind users they can submit feedback** (use sparingly, not every response):

**When to mention**:
- ✅ After explaining a complex module or mechanism
- ✅ When user asks detailed technical questions (shows engagement)
- ✅ If you notice a gap or potential error in documentation
- ✅ When user corrects you or provides additional context
- ❌ Not on simple factual queries
- ❌ Not more than once every 3-4 responses

**How to mention** (pick one style, keep it brief):
```
📝 Spot an error or have insights to share? Use /feedback to help improve the documentation!
```
Or:
```
💡 Your question revealed interesting details - consider using /feedback to document this for others!
```

**Goal**: Encourage quality feedback without being annoying. Users should feel invited, not pestered.

## 📐 DOCUMENT ROLE HIERARCHY

**MAgPIE has 82+ documentation files. To avoid confusion and inconsistency, follow this hierarchy:**

### **Two Contexts: MAgPIE Questions vs. Documentation Project**

#### **Context 1: Answering MAgPIE Questions** (most common)

**Document precedence** (if information conflicts):
1. **Code Truth**: `../modules/XX_name/realization/*.gms` (actual GAMS code)
2. **Module Docs**: `modules/module_XX.md` (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH - verified against code)
3. **Cross-Module**: `cross_module/*.md` (system-level analysis, derived from modules)
4. **Architecture**: `core_docs/Phase*.md` (overview and reference)
5. **Module Notes**: `modules/module_XX_notes.md` (user experience, warnings - may lag behind code changes)
6. **Workflow**: `CLAUDE.md` (routing logic, not facts about modules)

**Read in this order:**
```
User asks MAgPIE question
  → CLAUDE.md (you're reading it - tells you WHERE to look)
  → modules/module_XX.md (FACTS about the module)
  → module_XX_notes.md (WARNINGS/LESSONS if how-to/troubleshooting)
  → cross_module/*.md (SYSTEM-LEVEL if safety/dependencies)
  → core_docs/Phase*.md (ARCHITECTURE if structural question)
  → reference/GAMS_Phase*.md (GAMS CODE if writing/debugging code)
```

**DO NOT read** (noise for MAgPIE questions):
- ❌ README.md (documentation project overview - only read if working on doc project)
- ❌ CURRENT_STATE.json (documentation project status - only read if working on doc project)
- ❌ CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md (active initiative documentation - only read if working on doc project)

#### **Context 2: Working on Documentation Project** (rare)

**Read in this order:**
```
New documentation project session
  → README.md (orientation and session protocol)
  → CURRENT_STATE.json (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for project status)
  → CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md (if active initiative exists)
  → Ask user: "What should I work on?"
```

**Update ONLY:**
- ✅ CURRENT_STATE.json (project status)
- ❌ NOT README.md (STATIC reference document)
- ❌ NOT modules/README.md (STATIC reference)

### **Handling Conflicts**

**If you find contradictory information:**

1. **Check precedence hierarchy** (above)
2. **Trust higher-precedence source** (code > module docs > cross-module > notes)
3. **Create feedback** if notes contradict main docs:
   ```bash
   # Use /feedback command to report inconsistency
   ```

**Example conflict resolution:**
```
module_52_notes.md says: "Chapman-Richards has 3 parameters"
module_52.md says: "Chapman-Richards: C(age) = A × (1-exp(-k×age))^m (3 parameters)"

Action: Trust module_52.md (higher precedence)
Reason: Notes may be outdated, main doc is verified against code
```

### **Special Cases**

**Module Dependencies:**
- **Authoritative source**: `Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md` (dependency graph)
- **Quick reference**: `modification_safety_guide.md` (top 4 modules)
- **Module-specific**: `module_XX.md` (lists dependents for that module)
- **User warnings**: `module_XX_notes.md` (practical lessons about dependencies)

**If counts differ** → Trust Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md, create feedback

**Conservation Laws:**
- **Authoritative source**: `cross_module/*_balance_conservation.md`
- **Quick reference**: `module_XX.md` (mentions relevant equations)

**If formulas differ** → Trust cross_module file (comprehensive analysis), verify against code

**GAMS Syntax:**
- **Authoritative source**: Official GAMS documentation (gams.com)
- **MAgPIE patterns**: `reference/GAMS_Phase5_MAgPIE_Patterns.md`
- **Quick reference**: `Phase1_Core_Architecture.md` (naming conventions overview)

**If patterns differ** → Trust GAMS_Phase5 for MAgPIE-specific patterns

### **Quality Assurance**

**Before citing information, verify:**
- [ ] Is this from the highest-precedence source?
- [ ] If multiple sources, do they agree?
- [ ] If conflict, did I use precedence hierarchy?
- [ ] If notes contradict main docs, did I trust main docs?
- [ ] If unsure, can I verify against code?

**When in doubt:**
- State: "I found conflicting information in [source A] and [source B]"
- Apply precedence hierarchy
- Offer to verify against actual GAMS code
- Create feedback for the inconsistency
