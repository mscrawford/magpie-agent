## 🔄 Integration Workflow (Staged Approach)

### **NEW: Staged Workflow** ✨

Feedback now flows through a **staged validation process** to maintain stability of core docs while enabling continuous feedback flow.

### For Contributors (Unchanged)

1. **Submit** feedback using script or template
   ```bash
   ./scripts/submit_feedback.sh
   ```
2. **Feedback goes to**: `feedback/pending/module_XX/` (core docs untouched)
3. **Commit** and push
4. Done! Your feedback is now pending integration

### For Maintainers (Enhanced)

**Periodic Integration Sessions** (weekly, monthly, or as needed):

1. **Scan pending feedback**:
   ```bash
   /integrate-feedback              # Interactive mode
   # OR
   /integrate-feedback module_10    # Single module
   # OR
   /integrate-feedback all          # All pending feedback
   ```

2. **Agent validates** each item:
   - ✅ Valid: Applies to current code
   - ⚠️ Outdated: Code changed, needs updating
   - ❌ Incorrect: Contains errors

3. **Review integration proposal**:
   - See what will be integrated
   - Which files will be updated (module_XX.md or module_XX_notes.md)
   - What will be archived

4. **Approve and execute**:
   - Agent routes corrections → `module_XX.md` (fixes errors)
   - Agent routes warnings/lessons → `module_XX_notes.md` (user experience)
   - Archives to `integrated/`
   - Updates timestamps
   - Removes from `pending/`

5. **Commit** batch integration

### Key Differences from Old Workflow

**OLD**: Submit → Immediate review → Immediate integration → Update docs
- Risk: Core docs could become unstable
- Friction: Every submission needs immediate attention

**NEW**: Submit → Accumulate in pending/ → Periodic batch integration → Update notes files
- ✅ Core docs (`module_XX.md`) stay stable (only change when code changes)
- ✅ User feedback (`module_XX_notes.md`) updated in validated batches
- ✅ No submission friction
- ✅ Controlled integration with validation

---

## 📊 Where Feedback Goes

### Module-Specific Feedback
- **Submission**: `feedback/pending/module_XX/` (e.g., `pending/module_10/warning_land_2025-10-26.md`)
- **After Integration**: `modules/module_XX_notes.md`
- **Contains:** Warnings, lessons, corrections specific to that module
- **Agent reads:** When answering questions about Module XX (if how-to/troubleshooting)
- **Core docs unchanged**: `modules/module_XX.md` stays stable (verified against code)

### Global Feedback
- **Submission**: `feedback/pending/global/`
- **After Integration**: `feedback/global/claude_lessons.md`
- **Contains:** Agent behavior improvements, workflow enhancements
- **Used to update:** CLAUDE.md (agent instructions)

### Cross-Module Feedback
- **Submission**: `feedback/pending/global/` (mark as cross-module in content)
- **After Integration**: `feedback/global/cross_module_lessons.md`
- **Contains:** Interactions between modules, system-level insights

### Flow Summary

## ✅ Integration Checklist

Before marking feedback as integrated:

- [ ] Content added to appropriate notes file or documentation
- [ ] Unique ID assigned (W001, L001, C001, etc.)
- [ ] Date and source recorded
- [ ] If correction: main doc also updated
- [ ] If global: CLAUDE.md or workflow updated
- [ ] Cross-references added
- [ ] "Last updated" date refreshed
- [ ] Feedback moved to `integrated/`
- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message

## 💡 Tips for Good Feedback

### Be Specific
❌ "Module 70 is confusing"
✅ "Module 70 docs don't explain that q70_feed operates at regional level, not cell level"

### Provide Context
Include:
- What you were trying to do
- What went wrong or what you learned
- How to verify or reproduce

### Cite Sources
Reference:
- Specific code files and line numbers
- Papers or documentation
- Other modules or sections

### Make It Actionable
Suggest:
- What should change
- Where it should go
- How to implement

## 🗜️ Feedback Workflow: Two Commands

The feedback system uses **two sequential commands**:

### `/integrate-feedback` - Process Pending Submissions

**Purpose**: Validate and integrate new user feedback

**When to use**: Weekly or monthly, whenever feedback accumulates

**Command**:
```bash
/integrate-feedback module_10     # Single module
/integrate-feedback all           # All pending feedback
/integrate-feedback               # Interactive mode
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Scans `feedback/pending/` for new submissions
2. ✅ Validates each item against current code
3. ✅ Routes corrections/missing → `module_XX.md` (fixes errors in core docs)
4. ✅ Routes warnings/lessons → `module_XX_notes.md` (user experience)
5. ✅ Archives to `integrated/` with batch report
6. ✅ Updates timestamps
7. ✅ Removes from `pending/`

**Key principle**: Type-based routing prevents "notes purgatory" - corrections actually fix core docs!

---

### `/compress-documentation` - Reduce Bloat (Optional)

**Purpose**: Consolidate accumulated feedback to reduce bloat

**When to use**: Quarterly, or when notes files feel verbose (AFTER multiple integrations)

**Command**:
```bash
/compress-documentation     # Analyze and compress integrated feedback
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Analyzes patterns in `integrated/` feedback
2. ✅ Identifies consolidation opportunities (redundant warnings, scattered lessons)
3. ✅ Proposes before/after with line reductions
4. ✅ Updates `module_XX_notes.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, global lessons (with approval)
5. ✅ Maintains traceability with feedback IDs
6. ✅ Tracks compression metadata

**What gets compressed**:
- ✅ `module_XX_notes.md` - User warnings, lessons, examples
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Agent behavioral guidance (if bloated)
- ✅ `feedback/global/claude_lessons.md` - System-wide lessons
- ❌ **NEVER** `module_XX.md` - Core docs (facts are sacred!)

**What compression does**:
- ✅ Consolidates redundant warnings into comprehensive versions
- ✅ Organizes scattered lessons into coherent sections
- ✅ Preserves all unique insights with traceability

**What compression does NOT do**:
- ❌ Delete unique information
- ❌ Remove important warnings
- ❌ Compress core technical documentation
- ❌ Break traceability to original feedback

---

### Recommended Workflow

**They are SEQUENTIAL, not alternatives**: Integrate first (always), then compress later (sometimes).

1. **Regular Integration** (weekly/monthly): `/integrate-feedback all`
   - Keeps `pending/` clean
   - Validates and integrates user feedback
   - Updates core docs (corrections) and notes files (warnings/lessons)

2. **Periodic Compression** (quarterly, optional): `/compress-documentation`
   - Reduces bloat in notes files and agent guidance
   - Organizes feedback into coherent sections
   - Maintains quality while reducing redundancy

**Timeline example**:
```
Week 1-4: Submit feedback → /integrate-feedback
Week 5-8: Submit feedback → /integrate-feedback
Week 9-12: Submit feedback → /integrate-feedback
Month 3: Notes feeling bloated → /compress-documentation
Month 4+: Back to /integrate-feedback (cycle continues)
```
