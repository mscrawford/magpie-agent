      "âœ… Identified temporal dynamics vs. static structure query patterns",
      "âœ… Documented policy implementation mechanisms (target+penalty, hard constraint, cost-based)",
      "âœ… Enhanced AI_Agent_Behavior_Guide.md with 5 new advanced patterns (582 lines added)",
      "âœ… Updated Code_Truth_Principles.md with parameterized vs. implemented verification (67 lines added)",
