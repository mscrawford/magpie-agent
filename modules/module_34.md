# Module 34: Urban Land - Complete Documentation

**Status**: ✅ Fully Verified
**Realization**: exo_nov21 (default), static
**Equations**: 5 (exo_nov21), 0 (static)
**Lines of Code**: ~217 (exo_nov21), ~40 (static)

---

## Purpose

Module 34 (Urban Land) represents urban settlement areas in MAgPIE as one of the land modules (alongside cropland 30, pasture 31, forestry 32, and natural vegetation 35). It provides exogenous urban land expansion trajectories based on SSP scenarios and calculates corresponding biodiversity values (`module.gms:8-14`).

---

## Critical Characteristics

### What Module 34 DOES

1. **Prescribes urban land expansion** from LUH3 data (Hurtt 2020) with SSP-specific scenarios (`realization.gms:8`)
2. **Enforces regional urban land totals** via hard constraint (equation q34_urban_land) (`equations.gms:30-31`)
3. **Allows cell-level flexibility** with strong punishment costs for deviating from prescribed values (`input.gms:13`, 1e6 USD17MER/ha)
4. **Calculates biodiversity values** for urban land using BII coefficients (`equations.gms:34-35`)
5. **Fixes urban carbon stocks to zero** (no data available on urban land carbon density) (`presolve.gms:8`)

### What Module 34 does NOT do

1. **Does NOT model endogenous urbanization** - no response to economic growth, population density, or land prices
2. **Does NOT include urban land carbon stocks** - assumed zero due to missing data
3. **Does NOT model urban land use intensity** - all urban land treated homogeneously
4. **Does NOT distinguish urban types** - residential, commercial, industrial, infrastructure aggregated
5. **Does NOT interact with other modules dynamically** - only reduces available land pool
6. **Does NOT model urban-rural land transitions** - expansion is one-way (urban land cannot convert back)

---

## Realizations

### 1. exo_nov21 (Default)

**Approach**: Exogenous urban expansion with cell-level flexibility and regional constraint

**Data Source**: LUH3 (LUH2v2: Hurtt et al. 2020, LUH3: publication pending) cellular (0.5°) dataset (`realization.gms:8`)

**Scenario Selection**: 5 SSP scenarios (SSP1-5) with historical baseline frozen to SSP2 until sm_fix_SSP2 year (`sets.gms:9-10`, `preloop.gms:10-14`)

**Key Feature**: High punishment costs (1e6 USD17/ha) incentivize matching input data at cell level while hard regional constraint ensures exact regional totals (`input.gms:13`, `equations.gms:30-31`)

### 2. static

**Approach**: Urban land fixed to 1995 LUH2 baseline throughout simulation (`static/realization.gms:8-9`)

**Usage**: Historical counterfactual scenarios (e.g., "no urban expansion" sensitivity)

**Key Feature**: All variables fixed in presolve - vm_land, vm_carbon_stock, vm_bv, vm_cost_urban (`static/presolve.gms:9-14`)

---

## Model Equations (exo_nov21)

### 1. q34_urban_cost1 - Below-Target Deviation Cost

**Formula** (`equations.gms:17-18`):
```
v34_cost1(j2) =g= sum(ct, i34_urban_area(ct, j2)) - vm_land(j2,"urban")
```

**Purpose**: Captures cost when cell urban land is BELOW prescribed value (urban expansion constraint binding elsewhere)

**Mechanism**: If vm_land(j2,"urban") < i34_urban_area, the difference enters v34_cost1 (inequality ensures v34_cost1 ≥ difference, zero otherwise)

**Example** (illustrative numbers):
- Prescribed urban area i34_urban_area = 100 ha
- Actual urban land vm_land = 80 ha (shortage due to protected areas)
- v34_cost1 = 20 ha (minimum value satisfying inequality)
- Cost incurred = 20 ha × 1e6 USD17/ha = 20 million USD17

*Note: Actual values require reading input file f34_urbanland.cs3*

---

### 2. q34_urban_cost2 - Above-Target Deviation Cost

**Formula** (`equations.gms:20-21`):
```
v34_cost2(j2) =g= vm_land(j2,"urban") - sum(ct, i34_urban_area(ct, j2))
```

**Purpose**: Captures cost when cell urban land is ABOVE prescribed value (urban expansion reallocated from other cells)

**Mechanism**: If vm_land(j2,"urban") > i34_urban_area, the difference enters v34_cost2 (inequality ensures v34_cost2 ≥ difference, zero otherwise)

**Asymmetry**: Both cost1 and cost2 use same punishment scalar (1e6 USD17/ha), so under- and over-expansion penalized equally (`input.gms:13`)

---

### 3. q34_urban_cell - Total Cell-Level Cost

**Formula** (`equations.gms:25-26`):
```
vm_cost_urban(j2) =e= (v34_cost1(j2) + v34_cost2(j2)) * s34_urban_deviation_cost
```

**Purpose**: Aggregates both deviation costs (below and above target) with strong punishment scalar

**Parameters**:
- s34_urban_deviation_cost = 1e6 USD17/ha (`input.gms:13`)
- Scaling: vm_cost_urban.scale(j) = 10e3 for numerical stability (`scaling.gms:8`)

**Interface**: vm_cost_urban(j) provided to Module 11 (Costs) for inclusion in objective function

**Mechanism**: Only one of (v34_cost1, v34_cost2) can be positive for any cell (either below or above target, not both simultaneously)

---

### 4. q34_urban_land - Regional Total Constraint

**Formula** (`equations.gms:30-31`):
```
sum(cell(i2,j2), vm_land(j2,"urban")) =e= sum((ct,cell(i2,j2)), i34_urban_area(ct,j2))
```

**Purpose**: Ensures regional urban land EXACTLY matches prescribed regional total from LUH3 data (hard constraint, not soft penalty)

**Mechanism**:
- LHS: Sum of cell-level urban land (vm_land) across all cells in region i2
- RHS: Sum of prescribed cell-level urban area (i34_urban_area) across same cells
- Equality (=e=) enforces exact match, no tolerance

**Interaction with Cell-Level Flexibility**:
- Regional constraint satisfied exactly (hard)
- Cell-level distribution flexible via punishment costs (soft)
- Model reallocates urban expansion within regions to resolve local infeasibilities (e.g., conservation constraints)

**Example** (illustrative):
- Region has 3 cells: prescribed urban = [100, 50, 30] ha = 180 ha total
- Cell 1 has NPI constraint → actual urban = [60, 90, 30] ha = 180 ha total ✓
- Regional total preserved (180 ha), cell 1 deficit (40 ha) offset by cell 2 surplus (40 ha)
- Cell-level costs incurred: cell 1 pays 40 million USD17, cell 2 pays 40 million USD17

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration*

---

### 5. q34_bv_urban - Biodiversity Value

**Formula** (`equations.gms:34-35`):
```
vm_bv(j2,"urban", potnatveg) =e= vm_land(j2,"urban") * fm_bii_coeff("urban",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg)
```

**Purpose**: Calculates biodiversity value (BV) for urban land based on Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) methodology

**Components**:
- vm_land(j2,"urban"): Urban land area in cell j (Mha)
- fm_bii_coeff("urban",potnatveg): BII coefficient for urban land type (potential natural vegetation specific)
- fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg): Potential natural vegetation area share in cell j

**Mechanism**: Urban land has LOW BII coefficients (biodiversity impact high), weighted by potential natural vegetation type that would exist without human land use

**Interface**: vm_bv(j,"urban",potnatveg) provided to biodiversity accounting module (likely Module 44)

**Initialization**: vm_bv.l set in preloop using 1995 baseline urban area (`preloop.gms:20-21`)

---

---

## Key Parameters and Switches

### Configuration Switches

**c34_urban_scenario** (`input.gms:8`):
- Options: "SSP1", "SSP2", "SSP3", "SSP4", "SSP5"
- Default: "SSP2"
- Effect: Selects urban expansion trajectory after historical calibration period (sm_fix_SSP2)

### Scalar Parameters

**s34_urban_deviation_cost** (`input.gms:13`):
- Value: 1e6 USD17MER/ha
- Purpose: Strong punishment for deviating from prescribed cell-level urban area
- Effect: Makes cell-level reallocation very expensive (used only when infeasible to match prescribed values)

### Temporal Parameters

**i34_urban_area(t_all, j)** - prescribed urban area trajectory
- Historical (until sm_fix_SSP2): SSP2 for all scenarios (calibration) (`preloop.gms:10-11`)
- Future (after sm_fix_SSP2): Scenario-specific (SSP1-5) (`preloop.gms:12-13`)
- Units: Mha (million hectares)

---

## Implementation Details

### Scenario Selection Logic

**Two-stage trajectory** (`preloop.gms:9-15`):

1. **Historical calibration** (t ≤ sm_fix_SSP2):
   - All scenarios use SSP2 urban data
   - Ensures consistent historical baseline across scenario comparisons

2. **Scenario divergence** (t > sm_fix_SSP2):
   - Switch to configured scenario (c34_urban_scenario)
   - SSP1: Lower urban expansion (sustainable development)
   - SSP3: Higher urban sprawl (regional rivalry)
   - SSP5: Rapid urbanization (fossil-fueled development)

### First Timestep Special Treatment

**t=1 (model initialization)** (`presolve.gms:10-11`):
- vm_land.fx(j,"urban") = i34_urban_area(t,j)
- Urban land FIXED (.fx) to prescribed value (no optimization)
- Reason: Establishes initial conditions matching LUH3 baseline

**t>1 (optimization timesteps)** (`presolve.gms:12-15`):
- vm_land.lo(j,"urban") = 0 (no lower bound)
- vm_land.l(j,"urban") = i34_urban_area(t,j) (initialized to target)
- vm_land.up(j,"urban") = Inf (no upper bound)
- Reason: Allows optimizer flexibility to resolve infeasibilities via punishment costs

### Cost Structure Design

**Why two cost variables (v34_cost1, v34_cost2)?**

1. **Mathematical requirement**: Only one deviation direction can be positive at a time (either below OR above target, not both)
2. **Solver efficiency**: Separate variables with ≥ constraints allow GAMS to identify active constraint (below vs above) automatically
3. **Diagnostic value**: Post-processing can identify which cells expanded too much (cost2 > 0) vs. too little (cost1 > 0)

**Alternative (not used)**: Absolute value formulation |vm_land - i34_urban_area| requires non-smooth function or integer variables

---

## Module Interactions

### Upstream Modules (provide data to Module 34)

None - Module 34 is a data provider, reads only from external input files (LUH3)

### Downstream Modules (receive data from Module 34)

1. **Module 10 (Land)**: Receives vm_land(j,"urban") for land balance constraint
   - Urban land competes with other land types (crop, pasture, forest, natural vegetation)
   - Urban expansion reduces available land pool for agriculture/forestry

2. **Module 11 (Costs)**: Receives vm_cost_urban(j) for objective function
   - High punishment costs ensure prescribed urban area matched when feasible
   - Deviation costs incurred only when local constraints force reallocation

3. **Module 52 (Carbon)**: Receives vm_carbon_stock(j,"urban",*) = 0 for carbon accounting
   - Urban land contributes zero to carbon balance (data limitation)
   - Urban expansion emits carbon from previous land use (e.g., forest → urban)

4. **Module 44 (Biodiversity)**: Receives vm_bv(j,"urban",potnatveg) for BV aggregation
   - Urban land has low BII (high biodiversity impact)
   - Urban expansion reduces landscape-level biodiversity value

---

## Participates In

### Conservation Laws

**Land Balance**: ✅ **PARTICIPANT** - Provides `vm_land(j,"urban")` (exogenous expansion from LUH3). Regional totals are **HARD constraints** (must equal prescribed values). Cell-level allocation flexible with strong punishment costs (1e6 USD17/ha) for deviation. Reduces available land for agriculture/forestry.

**Carbon Balance**: ⚠️ **LIMITATION** - Urban land carbon set to **ZERO** (no data for urban vegetation). This is an oversimplification - real urban areas have trees, parks, green roofs with carbon stocks.

**All Other Laws**: ❌ Does NOT participate (Food, Water, Nitrogen)

**Cross-Reference**: `cross_module/land_balance_conservation.md` (Section 5.6, "Module 34 Exogenous Urban Expansion")

---

### Dependency Chains

**Centrality**: ~30 of 46 modules (moderate-low centrality)
**Total Connections**: 3-4 (provides to 3-4, depends on 1)
**Hub Type**: Data Provider with soft constraints (exogenous expansion)

**Provides To**: Module 10 (Land), Module 11 (Costs - deviation penalties), Module 22 (Conservation - potentially), Module 44 (Biodiversity - urban BII)

**Depends On**: Module 09 (Drivers - LUH3 scenarios)

**Key Role**: Enforces exogenous urban expansion trajectory from socioeconomic scenarios.

---

### Circular Dependencies

**Participates In**: ZERO circular dependencies (exogenous expansion, no feedbacks)

---

### Modification Safety

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW RISK**

**Safe**: Adjusting deviation cost parameters, changing LUH3 input scenarios, modifying cell-level allocation logic
**Dangerous**: Setting regional targets > available land (causes infeasibility), removing punishment costs (allows unrealistic urban distribution)
**Required Testing**: Land balance (urban + other land types = total), regional urban totals match targets
**Common Issues**: Urban expansion too aggressive → reduces land for food production → model infeasible → reduce urban growth rate in LUH3 scenarios

**Why Low Risk**: Pure data provider (exogenous), minimal feedbacks, only affects land availability and total costs. Cannot violate conservation laws except land balance (easily tested).

---

## Limitations

### 1. Exogenous Urbanization (no economic feedback)

**What's missing**: Urban expansion does NOT respond to:
- Agricultural land prices (high land values might slow sprawl)
- Transportation costs (distance to markets)
- Regional economic growth (employment centers)
- Land-use policies (urban growth boundaries, zoning)

**Implication**: Urban land trajectory predetermined by SSP narrative, cannot be influenced by MAgPIE-endogenous factors (food prices, carbon prices, conservation policies)

**Code evidence**: i34_urban_area loaded from input file, never updated based on model variables (`preloop.gms:9-15`)

### 2. Zero Urban Carbon Stocks

**What's missing**: Urban land carbon density set to zero (`presolve.gms:8`)

**Reason**: Missing data on urban vegetation (street trees, parks, lawns), soil carbon under pavement, buildings (wood products)

**Implication**:
- Carbon emissions from land conversion to urban UNDER-estimated (only previous land's carbon counted, not urban carbon accumulation)
- Urban greening potential (parks, urban forestry) not represented
- Demolition/construction carbon flows omitted

### 3. Homogeneous Urban Land

**What's missing**: No distinction between:
- Residential vs. commercial vs. industrial
- High-density vs. low-density (sprawl vs. compact city)
- Infrastructure (roads, airports) vs. buildings

**Implication**: Cannot model:
- Urban densification strategies (reduce per-capita land demand)
- Mixed-use development (co-location of housing and jobs)
- Green infrastructure (permeable surfaces, urban agriculture)

### 4. One-Way Urban Transition

**What's missing**: Urban land cannot convert back to non-urban uses

**Mechanism**: Lower bound vm_land.lo(j,"urban") = 0, but regional constraint sum(vm_land(j,"urban")) = sum(i34_urban_area(j)) with i34_urban_area monotonically increasing in all SSPs (`presolve.gms:13`)

**Implication**: Cannot model:
- Urban shrinkage (Detroit, Rust Belt cities)
- Urban greening (demolition → parks)
- Agricultural reclamation (abandoned suburbs)

**Real-world relevance**: Some regions experience de-urbanization (population decline, industrial collapse)

### 5. Cell-Level Flexibility Limited

**What's missing**: While regional totals fixed, cell-level reallocation has extreme cost (1e6 USD17/ha)

**Implication**: Model rarely deviates from prescribed cell-level urban area (only when absolute infeasibility forces reallocation, e.g., 100% of cell protected)

**Effect**: Urban spatial pattern essentially exogenous despite optimization formulation

### 6. No Urban Land Quality

**What's missing**: All urban land treated equally regardless of:
- Soil quality of converted land (urban on prime cropland vs. marginal land)
- Slope, flood risk (urbanization in hazardous areas)
- Ecosystem services lost (urban on wetlands vs. degraded land)

**Implication**: Cannot model:
- Smart urban planning (avoid high-value agricultural land)
- Disaster risk (flood-prone urban areas)
- Restoration opportunities (preferentially de-urbanize sensitive areas)

### 7. SSP Scenario Lock-In

**What's missing**: Urban trajectory fully determined by SSP choice, no scenario blending or sensitivity analysis within runs

**Code evidence**: Single scenario selected via c34_urban_scenario switch (`input.gms:8`)

**Implication**:
- Cannot model regional differentiation (SSP2 in Europe, SSP3 in Africa)
- Cannot explore urban policy shocks (e.g., accelerated urbanization)
- Post-2100 trajectories undefined (SSP data typically ends at 2100)

### 8. No Urban Land Services

**What's missing**: Urban land produces no outputs (housing, infrastructure services) that might interact with agricultural economy

**Implication**: Cannot model:
- Urban food demand location (affects transport costs)
- Urban waste as agricultural input (compost, wastewater)
- Urban-rural economic linkages (remittances, labor migration)

### 9. Biodiversity Calculation Simplified

**What's present**: BII coefficient applied uniformly to all urban land (`equations.gms:34-35`)

**What's missing**:
- Urban green space differentiation (parks vs. pavement)
- Urban habitat heterogeneity (gardens, street trees)
- Edge effects (urban-natural boundaries)

**Implication**: Urban biodiversity value likely OVER-estimated (all urban land treated as equally low BII, but parks/gardens have moderate BII)

### 10. LUH3 Data Vintage

**What's missing**: LUH3 dataset not yet published (as of Nov 2021 realization date)

**Uncertainty**:
- LUH2v2 (Hurtt et al. 2020) documented
- LUH3 improvements unknown ("publication not yet available" in `realization.gms:8`)
- Methodology changes between LUH2 and LUH3 not documented

**Implication**: Users cannot verify urban data provenance or assess uncertainties

## Usage Notes

### When to Use exo_nov21

- Standard MAgPIE runs with SSP-consistent urbanization
- Scenarios exploring agricultural land competition under urban growth
- Climate mitigation scenarios (urban expansion affects available land for afforestation/bioenergy)

### When to Use static

- Historical counterfactual: "What if urbanization stopped in 1995?"
- Sensitivity analysis: Isolate urban expansion effects
- Computational efficiency: Eliminate 5 equations and 3 variables (marginal savings)

### Interpreting Results

**Urban land outputs**:
- **vm_land(j,"urban")**: Urban area by cell (Mha)
- **vm_cost_urban(j)**: Deviation cost (USD17MER) - should be near-zero in feasible solutions
- **v34_cost1(j), v34_cost2(j)**: Direction of deviation (below vs. above target)

**Diagnostic checks**:
1. Sum(j, vm_land(j,"urban")) should equal sum(j, i34_urban_area(t,j)) exactly (regional constraint)
2. vm_cost_urban(j) > 0 indicates local infeasibility (protected areas blocking urban expansion)
3. Large v34_cost1 or v34_cost2 signals prescribed urban pattern incompatible with other constraints

---

## Technical Implementation

### Variable Bounds

**exo_nov21** (`presolve.gms:10-15`):
- **t=1**: vm_land.fx(j,"urban") = i34_urban_area(t,j) (fixed)
- **t>1**: vm_land.lo/up(j,"urban") = 0/Inf (unbounded), .l = i34_urban_area(t,j) (initialized)

**static** (`static/presolve.gms:9`):
- **All t**: vm_land.fx(j,"urban") = pcm_land(j,"urban") = i34_urban_area("y1995",j) (fixed to 1995)

### Scaling

**vm_cost_urban.scale(j) = 10e3** (`scaling.gms:8`):
- Purpose: Numerical stability when costs reach millions USD17
- Effect: GAMS solver sees vm_cost_urban/10e3 internally (rescaled to ~1-1000 range)

**v34_cost1, v34_cost2 scaling commented out** (`scaling.gms:9-10`):
- Original: v34_cost1.scale(j) = 10e-4, v34_cost2.scale(j) = 10e-4
- Reason for disabling: Likely caused solver issues (extreme rescaling), left for reference

## Summary

**Module 34 (Urban Land)** provides exogenous urban land expansion trajectories to MAgPIE based on LUH3 data and SSP scenarios. Urban land is prescribed at regional level (hard constraint) with cell-level flexibility via strong punishment costs. The module calculates biodiversity values for urban areas but assumes zero carbon stocks due to missing data.

**Key Trade-off**: Exogenous urbanization simplifies computation (no urban land markets) but cannot represent endogenous urban-agricultural land competition or policy responses to land scarcity.

**Primary Use**: Ensures MAgPIE land-use projections account for urban land expansion trends consistent with SSP narratives, reducing available land for agriculture, forestry, and nature conservation.

**Alternative Realization (static)**: Freezes urban land at 1995 baseline for counterfactual analysis ("no urbanization" scenarios).

**Critical Limitations**: No economic feedback, zero urban carbon, homogeneous urban land, one-way transitions, and simplified biodiversity calculation.
