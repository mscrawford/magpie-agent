## Purpose

Module 51 calculates **nitrogeneous emissions before technical mitigation**, including N₂O, NOₓ, NH₃, NO₃⁻, and N₂ from agricultural activities (`realization.gms:8-16`). The module receives nitrogen flow information from Modules 50 (NR Soil Budget), 55 (AWMS), 18 (Residues), and 59 (SOM), and provides emissions to Module 56 (GHG Policy) for potential pricing (`realization.gms:11-13`).

**Core Feature**: Uses **NUE-based rescaling** to maintain consistency between emissions and nitrogen surplus while accounting for improved emission factors when nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increases (`equations.gms:16-19`).

## Equations (8)

### 1. Manure on Cropland Emissions

**`q51_emissions_man_crop(i,n_pollutants_direct)`** (`equations.gms:22-27`)

Calculates emissions from manure applied to croplands (N₂O, NOₓ, NH₃, NO₃⁻).

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"man_crop",n_pollutants_direct)
=e=
vm_manure_recycling(i2,"nr")
/ (1-s51_snupe_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff(i2))
* sum(ct, i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i2,n_pollutants_direct,"man_crop"))
```

**Components**:
- `vm_manure_recycling(i2,"nr")`: Nitrogen from manure recycled to cropland (from Module 50) (`equations.gms:25`)
- `s51_snupe_base`: Base soil nitrogen uptake efficiency assumed in IPCC guidelines = 0.5 (`input.gms:8`)
- `vm_nr_eff(i2)`: Actual regional nitrogen use efficiency (from Module 50) (`equations.gms:26`)
- `i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i2,n_pollutants_direct,"man_crop")`: Emission factor for manure on cropland (`equations.gms:27`)

**Rescaling Logic**:
- Baseline emissions (IPCC methodology) assume 50% NUE: `vm_manure / (1-0.5)` = emissions at 50% NUE
- Scaling factor `(1-vm_nr_eff)` adjusts for actual NUE: higher NUE → lower emissions
- Example (illustrative): If actual NUE is 60% (vm_nr_eff=0.6) vs. base 50%, scaling = (1-0.6)/(1-0.5) = 0.4/0.5 = 0.8 → 20% emission reduction

### 2. Inorganic Fertilizer Emissions

**`q51_emissions_inorg_fert(i,n_pollutants_direct)`** (`equations.gms:30-39`)

Calculates emissions from inorganic fertilizer applied to **both cropland and pasture**.

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"inorg_fert",n_pollutants_direct)
=e=
vm_nr_inorg_fert_reg(i2,"crop")
/ (1-s51_snupe_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff(i2))
* sum(ct, i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i2,n_pollutants_direct,"inorg_fert"))
+ vm_nr_inorg_fert_reg(i2,"past")
/ (1-s51_nue_pasture_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff_pasture(i2))
* sum(ct, i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i2,n_pollutants_direct,"inorg_fert"))
```

**Key Features**:
- **Two-pool structure**: Crop fertilizer (line 33) + pasture fertilizer (line 36) calculated separately
- **Separate NUE for pasture**: Uses `vm_nr_eff_pasture` instead of `vm_nr_eff` (`equations.gms:37`)
- **Same base NUE assumption**: Both crop and pasture use base NUE = 0.5 (`input.gms:8-9`)
- **Single emission factor**: Same `i51_ef_n_soil` EF for both land uses (IPCC methodology) (`equations.gms:35,38`)

---

### 3. Crop Residue Emissions

**`q51_emissions_resid(i,n_pollutants_direct)`** (`equations.gms:42-46`)

Calculates emissions from crop residues decaying on fields.

=e=
vm_res_recycling(i2,"nr") * sum(ct, i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i2,n_pollutants_direct,"resid"))
/ (1-s51_snupe_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff(i2))
```

**Components**:
- `vm_res_recycling(i2,"nr")`: Nitrogen from crop residues left on fields (from Module 18) (`equations.gms:45`)
- Rescaling applied **after** emission factor multiplication (different ordering than manure equation, but mathematically equivalent)

---

vm_emissions_reg(i2,"resid_burn",n_pollutants_direct)
=e=
sum(kcr, vm_res_ag_burn(i2,kcr,"dm")) * f51_ef_resid_burn(n_pollutants_direct)
```

/ (1-s51_snupe_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff(i2))
```

**Spatial Resolution**:
- **Cell-to-region aggregation**: `vm_nr_som` provided at cell level `j2`, summed to regional level `i2` (`equations.gms:58`)
- Input: `vm_nr_som(j2)` from Module 59 (SOM) (`equations.gms:58`)
- NUE rescaling applied (SOM loss affects plant-available nitrogen pool)

---

### 6. Animal Waste Management Systems (AWMS) Emissions

**`q51_emissionbal_awms(i,n_pollutants_direct)`** (`equations.gms:65-71`)

Calculates emissions from manure managed in **confinement systems** (lagoons, slurry, solid storage, etc.).

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"awms",n_pollutants_direct)
=e=
sum((kli,awms_conf),
   vm_manure_confinement(i2,kli,awms_conf,"nr")
   * f51_ef3_confinement(i2,kli,awms_conf,n_pollutants_direct))
   * (1-sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"awms","n2o_n_direct")))
```

**Key Features**:
- **Livestock × management system**: Dimensions `kli` (5 livestock types) × `awms_conf` (9 confinement types) (`equations.gms:68`)
- **MACC mitigation applied**: Marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) reduce emissions via `im_maccs_mitigation` (`equations.gms:71`)
- **All pollutants affected**: MACC factor (based on N₂O) applied to NH₃, NOₓ, NO₃⁻ emissions too (`equations.gms:62-64`)
- **NO NUE rescaling**: AWMS emissions not related to crop uptake efficiency
- Confinement types (Module 55): lagoon, liquid_slurry, solid_storage, drylot, daily_spread, digester, other, pit_short, pit_long (Module 55 sets.gms:16-17)

**MACC Assumption**: Assumes mitigation measures (e.g., covered storage, reduced storage time) affect all N pollutants, not just N₂O (`equations.gms:62-64`).

---

### 7. Manure on Pasture Emissions

**`q51_emissionbal_man_past(i,n_pollutants_direct)`** (`equations.gms:74-80`)

Calculates emissions from manure excreted on **pasture, range, and paddocks** (grazing systems).

    * f51_ef3_prp(i2,n_pollutants_direct,kli))
/ (1-s51_nue_pasture_base) * (1-vm_nr_eff_pasture(i2))
```

**Key Features**:
- **Pasture NUE rescaling**: Uses `vm_nr_eff_pasture` (pasture-specific NUE from Module 50) (`equations.gms:80`)
- **Pasture AWMS only**: `awms_prp` subset = {grazing, stubble_grazing} (Module 55 sets.gms:13-14)
- **Livestock-specific EF**: Emission factors vary by livestock type `kli` (`equations.gms:79`)
- Input: `vm_manure(i2,kli,awms_prp,"nr")` from Module 55 (`equations.gms:78`)

---

### 8. Indirect N₂O Emissions

**`q51_emissions_indirect_n2o(i,emis_source_n51)`** (`equations.gms:83-89`)

Calculates **indirect N₂O emissions** from volatilized NH₃/NOₓ (redeposition) and leached NO₃⁻ (nitrification/denitrification in water bodies).

=e=
sum(pollutant_nh3no2_51,vm_emissions_reg(i2,emis_source_n51,pollutant_nh3no2_51))
   * f51_ipcc_ef("ef_4","best")
+ vm_emissions_reg(i2,emis_source_n51,"no3_n")
  * f51_ipcc_ef("ef_5","best")
```

**Components**:
- **Volatilization pathway**: NH₃ + NOₓ → atmospheric deposition → N₂O (IPCC EF4 = 0.01 tN₂O-N/tNH₃-N or NOₓ-N) (`equations.gms:86-87`)
- **Leaching pathway**: NO₃⁻ → groundwater/rivers → N₂O (IPCC EF5 = 0.0075 tN₂O-N/tNO₃-N) (`equations.gms:88-89`)
- **Emission source loop**: Calculated separately for each source `emis_source_n51` = {inorg_fert, man_crop, awms, resid, resid_burn, man_past, som} (`sets.gms:15-16`)
- **Best estimate**: Uses "best" uncertainty scenario (other options: "low", "high") (`equations.gms:87,89`)
- **Pollutant subsets**: `pollutant_nh3no2_51` = {nh3_n, no2_n} (Module 56 sets.gms:204-205)

**Indirect Emissions Process** (per IPCC 2006 Guidelines):
1. Direct emissions calculated in equations 1-7 → includes NH₃, NOₓ, NO₃⁻
2. NH₃/NOₓ volatilize → redeposit on land/water → undergo nitrification/denitrification → N₂O
3. NO₃⁻ leaches to groundwater → denitrified in aquatic systems → N₂O
4. Total N₂O = direct N₂O (equations 1-7) + indirect N₂O (equation 8)

---

## Execution Phases

### preloop (`preloop.gms:8-10`)

**Variable Bounds Initialization**:
- Fix all emission sources to zero: `vm_emissions_reg.fx(i,emis_source,n_pollutants) = 0` (`preloop.gms:8`)
- Unbound nitrogen emission sources:
  - `vm_emissions_reg.lo(i,emis_source_n51,n_pollutants) = -Inf` (`preloop.gms:9`)
  - `vm_emissions_reg.up(i,emis_source_n51,n_pollutants) = Inf` (`preloop.gms:10`)
- Effect: Only nitrogen sources (7 types) can have non-zero emissions; all other sources fixed at zero

### presolve (`presolve.gms:8-16`)

**Dynamic Emission Factor Update**:
```gams
if (sum(sameas(t_past,t),1) = 1,
  i51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...) = f51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...)     ! Historical: use time-varying data
else
  i51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...) = i51_ef_n_soil(t-1,i,...)   ! Future: repeat previous timestep
)
```

**Logic**:
- **Historical period** (t ∈ t_past): Load time-varying regional emission factors from input file (`presolve.gms:11-12`)
- **Future period**: Hold emission factors constant at final historical value (2010 baseline) (`presolve.gms:14-15`)
- **Rationale**: Leaching emissions climate-sensitive (temperature, precipitation affect NO₃⁻ transport); future climate impacts not dynamically modeled, so frozen at 2010 (`presolve.gms:8-9`)

### postsolve (`postsolve.gms:10-43`)

**Output Recording**: Save equation levels, marginals, and bounds to `oq51_*` parameters for R reporting (standard MAgPIE pattern)

---

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. NUE Rescaling Methodology

**Purpose**: Maintain consistency between nitrogen surplus (Module 50) and emissions while allowing emission factors to improve when NUE increases (`equations.gms:16-19`).

**Conceptual Basis**:
- IPCC 2006 emission factors implicitly assume ~50% crop nitrogen uptake efficiency
- If actual NUE is higher (e.g., 60%), less nitrogen available for loss processes → lower emissions
- Rescaling factor: `(1 - vm_nr_eff) / (1 - s51_snupe_base)` adjusts emissions proportionally

**Mathematical Derivation** (illustrative):
```
IPCC assumption: 50% uptake → 50% available for losses
Emissions_base = N_input × 0.5 × EF

If actual NUE = 60% → 40% available for losses
Emissions_actual = N_input × 0.4 × EF

Scaling factor = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8 → 20% emission reduction
```

**Equation Implementation** (e.g., manure on cropland):
```gams
Emissions = (N_input / (1 - 0.5)) × (1 - vm_nr_eff) × EF
          = N_input × 2 × (1 - vm_nr_eff) × EF
          = N_input × [(1 - vm_nr_eff) / (1 - 0.5)] × EF
          = N_input × scaling_factor × EF
```

**Applied To**:
- ✅ Manure on cropland (`equations.gms:26`)
- ✅ Inorganic fertilizer (crop and pasture) (`equations.gms:34,37`)
- ✅ Crop residues (`equations.gms:46`)
- ✅ SOM loss (`equations.gms:59`)
- ✅ Manure on pasture (`equations.gms:80`)
- ❌ NOT applied to: AWMS (independent of crop uptake), residue burning (combustion process)

### 2. Dual NUE System (Cropland vs. Pasture)

**Cropland NUE** (`vm_nr_eff`):
- Applied to: inorg fertilizer on crops, manure on crops, residues, SOM
- Typical range: 0.4-0.7 (40-70%)

**Pasture NUE** (`vm_nr_eff_pasture`):
- Applied to: inorg fertilizer on pasture, manure on pasture
- Generally lower than cropland (extensive grazing systems)
- Independent optimization in Module 50

**Rationale**: Different management intensities, plant types, and nitrogen cycling dynamics between cropland and pasture systems.

### 3. MACC Integration for AWMS

**Marginal Abatement Cost Curves** (`equations.gms:62-64,71`):
- MACCs represent technological mitigation options (e.g., anaerobic digesters, covered lagoons, reduced storage time)
- Optimization in Module 56 determines cost-effective mitigation level based on GHG prices
- `im_maccs_mitigation(t,i,"awms","n2o_n_direct")`: Fraction of baseline N₂O emissions mitigated (0-1)

**Application Assumption**:
- MACC derived for N₂O mitigation
- **Applied to ALL N pollutants** (NH₃, NOₓ, NO₃⁻) from AWMS (`equations.gms:62-64`)
- Justification: Mitigation measures (e.g., coverage, aeration) affect overall manure degradation pathway, not just N₂O-specific processes
- **Limitation**: May overestimate co-benefits for NH₃ (some measures reduce N₂O but increase NH₃ volatilization)

### 4. Indirect N₂O Calculation

**Two-Stage Process**:
1. **Direct emissions** (equations 1-7): Calculate NH₃, NOₓ, NO₃⁻ from all sources
2. **Indirect emissions** (equation 8): Convert volatilized/leached N to secondary N₂O

**IPCC Methodology**:
- **EF4** (volatilization-deposition-emission): 1% of NH₃-N and NOₓ-N emitted → redeposited → converted to N₂O
- **EF5** (leaching-emission): 0.75% of NO₃⁻-N leached → denitrified in water → converted to N₂O

**Source-Specific Accounting**: Indirect N₂O tracked separately for each emission source (7 sources) to maintain traceability for GHG accounting and policy targeting (`equations.gms:83-89`).

### 5. Climate-Dynamic vs. Static Emission Factors

**Historical Period** (pre-2010):
- Emission factors vary by timestep: `i51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...)` (`presolve.gms:11-12`)
- Captures observed changes in leaching (climate-driven) and other processes
- Calibrated to match historical emission inventories (e.g., FAO, EDGAR)

**Future Period** (post-2010):
- Emission factors frozen at 2010 levels: `i51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...) = i51_ef_n_soil(t-1,i,...)` (`presolve.gms:14-15`)
- **Limitation**: Climate change impacts on leaching (precipitation changes, temperature effects on denitrification) NOT dynamically modeled
- **Partial compensation**: NUE rescaling captures some management-driven emission intensity changes, but not climate-driven process rate changes

### Downstream Dependencies

| Module | Variables | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **56** (GHG Policy) | `vm_emissions_reg` | Emissions for GHG pricing, mitigation targets, reporting |

### Critical Hub Status

Module 51 is a **terminal calculation node**:
- Receives nitrogen flows from 5 upstream modules (50, 18, 55, 59, 56)
- Provides emissions to 1 downstream module (56)
- **No feedback loops**: Emissions do NOT affect nitrogen budgets or management decisions in current implementation
- **Potential extension**: Endogenous emission reduction (e.g., NUE response to GHG prices) would require Module 56 → Module 50 feedback

---

## Limitations & Assumptions

### 1. No Dynamic Climate Response (Post-2010)

**What the code does**: Holds emission factors constant at 2010 levels for all future timesteps (`presolve.gms:14-15`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT adjust leaching rates for future precipitation changes
- ❌ Does NOT adjust denitrification rates for future temperature changes
- ❌ Does NOT account for extreme weather events (floods, droughts) affecting emission pulses

**Impact**: May underestimate emissions in wetter/warmer futures, overestimate in drier futures.

### 2. MACC Co-Benefits Assumption

**What the code does**: Applies N₂O MACC mitigation factor uniformly to NH₃, NOₓ, NO₃⁻ emissions (`equations.gms:71`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT differentiate co-benefit ratios by pollutant (some measures reduce N₂O but increase NH₃)
- ❌ Does NOT account for trade-offs (e.g., covering slurry reduces NH₃ volatilization but may increase NO₃⁻ leaching if applied to fields)

**Impact**: May overestimate air quality co-benefits (NH₃, NOₓ reductions) of N₂O mitigation in AWMS.

### 3. No Rice Paddies Separate Treatment

**What the code does**: Includes "rice" in `emis_source_n_cropsoils51` set (`sets.gms:19`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT have dedicated equation for rice paddy emissions
- ❌ Does NOT model anaerobic conditions in flooded paddies (different N₂O:NOₓ ratio)
- ❌ Does NOT account for water management effects (continuous flooding vs. mid-season drainage)

**Impact**: Rice emissions likely folded into general cropland sources with generic emission factors (may underestimate N₂O from flooded paddies).

### 4. No Fire-Induced Deposition

**What the code does**: Calculates N₂O and NOₓ from residue burning (`equations.gms:49-52`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT track spatial deposition of fire-emitted NOₓ (affects where indirect N₂O occurs)
- ❌ Does NOT account for black carbon effects on soil N cycling post-fire
- ❌ Does NOT model emission height and long-range transport (all NOₓ treated as local deposition in equation 8)

**Impact**: Spatial distribution of indirect N₂O from fires may be inaccurate.

### 5. No Livestock-Specific Pasture NUE

**What the code does**: Uses single regional pasture NUE `vm_nr_eff_pasture(i)` for all livestock types (`equations.gms:80`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT differentiate NUE by grazing behavior (cattle vs. sheep rotational patterns)
- ❌ Does NOT account for stocking density effects on pasture N cycling
- ❌ Does NOT model selective grazing impacts on N uptake efficiency

**Impact**: Uniform pasture NUE may miss heterogeneity in extensive (low NUE) vs. improved (higher NUE) pasture systems.

### 6. No Nitrification Inhibitors or Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers

**What the code does**: Adjusts emissions via NUE rescaling based on overall nitrogen management efficiency (`equations.gms:26,34,46,59`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT explicitly model nitrification inhibitors (e.g., DCD, DMPP) that reduce N₂O and NO₃⁻
- ❌ Does NOT represent controlled-release fertilizers that reduce NH₃ volatilization
- ❌ Does NOT distinguish emission factors by fertilizer type (urea vs. ammonium nitrate vs. stabilized urea)

**Impact**: Emission reductions from specific fertilizer technologies represented only indirectly through NUE improvements (if captured in Module 50).

### 7. No Spatial Heterogeneity in Cropland Emission Factors

**What the code does**: Uses regional average emission factors `i51_ef_n_soil(t,i,...)` (`equations.gms:27,35,45,58`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT vary emission factors by soil type within region (sandy vs. clay soils have different denitrification rates)
- ❌ Does NOT account for topography (lowlands vs. uplands affect leaching)
- ❌ Does NOT represent within-region climate gradients (elevation, coastal vs. inland)

**Impact**: Regional aggregation smooths out hotspots and may misallocate emissions spatially.

### 8. No Temporal Dynamics (Annual Averages Only)

**What the code does**: Calculates total annual emissions per timestep (typically 5-10 year intervals) (`equations.gms:22-89`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model seasonal emission peaks (e.g., spring thaw N₂O pulses)
- ❌ Does NOT represent event-driven emissions (fertilization timing, heavy rainfall)
- ❌ Does NOT account for storage time effects on AWMS emissions (summer vs. winter volatilization rates)

**Impact**: Cannot evaluate sub-annual mitigation strategies (e.g., optimal fertilization timing).

### 9. No Crop Residue Quality Effects

**What the code does**: Uses single emission factor for all residue types (`equations.gms:45`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT differentiate by C:N ratio (high C:N residues immobilize N, reducing emissions)
- ❌ Does NOT account for lignin content (affects decomposition rate and N₂O production)
- ❌ Does NOT model residue placement (surface vs. incorporated affects O₂ availability and denitrification)

**Impact**: May miss emission variation between crop types (e.g., cereal straw vs. legume residues).

### 10. No Atmosphere-Biosphere Feedback

**What the code does**: Calculates emissions as one-way flow to atmosphere (`equations.gms:22-89`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model atmospheric N deposition back to land (emissions become inputs elsewhere)
- ❌ Does NOT account for NOₓ fertilization effect on vegetation (emitted NOₓ can enhance plant growth)
- ❌ Does NOT represent NH₃ redeposition hotspots near emission sources

**Impact**: Total system N balance incomplete (emissions leave model boundary); indirect N₂O equation 8 attempts partial correction but doesn't close spatial loop.

## Alternative Realization: `off`

**Purpose**: Disables nitrogen emission calculations (used for model testing or non-nitrogen scenarios).

**Implementation**: Sets all nitrogen emission variables to zero (checked via module folder structure, not documented in detail here).

---

## Model Uncertainty & Validation

### IPCC Uncertainty Estimates

**Emission factors include 3 uncertainty levels** (`sets.gms:9-10`):
- **best**: Central estimate (currently used in all equations)
- **low**: Lower bound (conservative emission estimate)
- **high**: Upper bound (pessimistic emission estimate)

**Current implementation**: Only "best" estimates used (`equations.gms:87,89`). Uncertainty analysis would require scenario runs with "low" and "high" parameter sets.

### Key Uncertainties (from IPCC 2006)

1. **Direct N₂O emission factors**: ±50% uncertainty range for most sources
2. **Indirect N₂O (EF4, EF5)**: ±100% uncertainty (poorly constrained processes)
3. **NH₃ volatilization rates**: ±30% (climate and management dependent)
4. **NO₃⁻ leaching fractions**: ±40% (soil and climate dependent)

### Validation Data Sources

**Historical calibration** (mentioned in `realization.gms:14-16`):
- Bodirsky et al. (2012): Validation against FAO emission inventories
- IPCC (2006): Methodological basis for emission factors
- Regional tuning via `f51_ef_n_soil_reg.cs3` input file

**Limitations**: No within-code validation metrics; external comparison required for confidence assessment.

## Code Quality Notes

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Comprehensive emission coverage**: All major agricultural N emission sources included (7 sources × 4 pollutants)
2. **IPCC compliance**: Methodology follows internationally accepted guidelines
3. **NUE consistency**: Rescaling maintains coherence with Module 50 nitrogen budgets
4. **Source tracking**: Separate accounting by emission source enables targeted policy analysis
5. **Indirect emissions**: Properly accounts for volatilization-deposition-emission cascade (often omitted in simpler models)

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **Climate stationarity**: Post-2010 emission factors frozen (climate change impacts on N cycling not captured)
2. **MACC co-benefits**: Uniform application to all pollutants may overestimate synergies
3. **Spatial aggregation**: Regional emission factors miss within-region heterogeneity
4. **No rice-specific treatment**: Generic cropland factors applied to flooded paddies
5. **Temporal resolution**: Annual averages miss seasonal dynamics and event-driven peaks

## Example Calculation (Illustrative)

**Scenario**: Calculate N₂O emissions from inorganic fertilizer on cropland in a hypothetical region.

**Given** (made-up numbers for illustration):
- Inorganic fertilizer applied: `vm_nr_inorg_fert_reg(i,"crop")` = 10 Mt N
- Actual cropland NUE: `vm_nr_eff(i)` = 0.6 (60%)
- Base IPCC NUE assumption: `s51_snupe_base` = 0.5 (50%)
- N₂O emission factor: `i51_ef_n_soil(ct,i,"n2o_n_direct","inorg_fert")` = 0.01 (1% of applied N → N₂O)

**Calculation** (from equation 2, crop fertilizer term, `equations.gms:33-35`):
```
Emissions = 10 / (1-0.5) × (1-0.6) × 0.01
          = 10 / 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.01
          = 20 × 0.4 × 0.01
          = 0.08 Mt N₂O-N
```

**Interpretation**:
- Baseline IPCC (50% NUE): 10 × 0.01 / (1-0.5) = 0.10 Mt N₂O-N (at 50% uptake → 50% available for losses)
- With 60% NUE rescaling: 0.08 Mt N₂O-N → **20% reduction** from improved efficiency
- Rescaling factor: (1-0.6)/(1-0.5) = 0.4/0.5 = 0.8 ✓

**Note**: All numbers in this example are illustrative. Actual values require reading input data files (`f51_ef_n_soil_reg.cs3`, Module 50 NUE outputs).
