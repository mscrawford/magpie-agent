# Module 28: Ageclass - Comprehensive AI Documentation

**Status**: 100% verified (all source files read, zero equations confirmed)
**Realization**: `oct24` (October 2024)
**Date Documented**: 2025-10-13
**Lines of Code**: ~120 (excluding input data)

---

## Overview

Module 28 (Ageclass) provides **forest area distribution by age-class** to support forest dynamics modeling in MAgPIE. This is a **pure data provider module** with:
- **0 equations** (no optimization components)
- **0 variables** (no decision variables)
- **1 parameter** (im_forest_ageclass) providing forest area by 5-year age-classes
- **2 dynamic sets** (ac_est, ac_sub) controlling age-class behavior in forestry module

The module loads forest age data from the **Global Forest Age Dataset (GFAD) v1.1** by Poulter et al. (2019) and transforms it from 15 ten-year classes to MAgPIE's 5-year age-class system.

**Key Purpose**: Initialize secondary forest age-class distribution (Module 35) and define establishment vs. sub-rotation age-classes for plantations (Module 32).

## Age-Class System

### GFAD Age-Class Structure

Module 28 defines **15 GFAD age-classes** (`ac_gfad`) representing 10-year age bands (sets.gms:9-12):

```
class1:  0-10 years
class2:  10-20 years
class3:  20-30 years
class4:  30-40 years
class5:  40-50 years
class6:  50-60 years
class7:  60-70 years
class8:  70-80 years
class9:  80-90 years
class10: 90-100 years
class11: 100-110 years
class12: 110-120 years
class13: 120-130 years
class14: 130-140 years
class15: 140+ years (includes primary forests)
```

**class15 special treatment**: Includes all forests ≥150 years old, including primary forests (preloop.gms:12-13).

### MAgPIE Age-Class Mapping

**Mapping**: 15 GFAD classes (10-year) → MAgPIE age-classes (5-year) (sets.gms:17-33)

**Transformation rule** (preloop.gms:10-11):
```gams
im_forest_ageclass(j,ac) = sum(ac_gfad_to_ac(ac_gfad,ac), f28_forestageclasses(j,ac_gfad)) / 2
```

**Logic**: Each 10-year GFAD class splits equally into two 5-year MAgPIE classes.

**Mapping table**:
```
class1  → (ac5, ac10)      [0-10 years → 0-5, 5-10]
class2  → (ac15, ac20)     [10-20 years → 10-15, 15-20]
class3  → (ac25, ac30)     [20-30 years → 20-25, 25-30]
class4  → (ac35, ac40)
class5  → (ac45, ac50)
class6  → (ac55, ac60)
class7  → (ac65, ac70)
class8  → (ac75, ac80)
class9  → (ac85, ac90)
class10 → (ac95, ac100)
class11 → (ac105, ac110)
class12 → (ac115, ac120)
class13 → (ac125, ac130)
class14 → (ac135, ac140)
class15 → acx              [140+ years, no splitting]
```

**Oldest class exception** (preloop.gms:14):
```gams
im_forest_ageclass(j,"acx") = f28_forestageclasses(j,"class15")
```
class15 (140+ years) maps directly to `acx` without splitting, representing mature/primary forests.

### Young Age-Classes

**Young age-class set** `ac_young` (sets.gms:14-15):
```
ac_young = {ac0, ac5, ac10, ac15, ac20, ac25, ac30}
```

**Purpose**: Represents forests 0-30 years old, likely including **disturbance-affected forests** (realization.gms:11-12).

**GFAD Limitation**: GFAD v1.1 likely includes disturbances (fires, storms, logging) in young age-classes, which MAgPIE does not model extensively, potentially creating **biases** (realization.gms:11-14).

---

## Dynamic Age-Class Sets

### Establishment Age-Classes (ac_est)

**Definition** (presolve.gms:9-10):
```gams
ac_est(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) <= (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))
```

**Meaning**: Age-classes **younger than or equal to current timestep length**.

**Purpose**: Represents forests **established during the current timestep** (Module 32 Forestry).

**Illustrative example** (made-up for clarity):
- If timestep length = 10 years (e.g., 2020→2030)
- m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = 10
- ord(ac) ≤ 10/5 = 2
- ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10} (forests 0-10 years old)

**Usage in Module 32**: Establishment age-classes **cannot be harvested or reduced** (dynamic_may24/presolve.gms:~280):
```gams
v32_hvarea_forestry.fx(j,ac_est) = 0
v32_land_reduction.fx(j,type32,ac_est) = 0
```

### Sub-Rotation Age-Classes (ac_sub)

**Definition** (presolve.gms:12-13):
```gams
ac_sub(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) > (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))
```

**Meaning**: Age-classes **older than current timestep length**.

**Purpose**: Represents forests **established in previous timesteps** (sub-rotation).

**Illustrative example** (continuing from above):
- If timestep length = 10 years
- ord(ac) > 10/5 = 2
- ac_sub = {ac15, ac20, ..., acx} (forests 15+ years old)

**Usage in Module 32**: Sub-rotation age-classes can be harvested or face disturbance losses (dynamic_may24/presolve.gms:~285):
```gams
p32_disturbance_loss_ftype32(t,j,"aff",ac_sub) =
  pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_sub) * f32_forest_shock(t,"%c32_shock_scenario%") * m_timestep_length
```

### ac_est and ac_sub Dynamics

**Time-varying sets**: ac_est and ac_sub **change each timestep** based on m_yeardiff_forestry(t).

**First timestep** (t=1): m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = 5 years (core/macros.gms)
- ac_est = {ac0, ac5} (0-5 years)
- ac_sub = {ac10, ac15, ..., acx} (10+ years)

**Subsequent timesteps** (t>1): m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = m_year(t) - m_year(t-1)
- If 5-year timesteps: ac_est = {ac0, ac5}
- If 10-year timesteps: ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10}
- If variable timesteps: ac_est size varies dynamically

**Implication**: Longer timesteps mean more age-classes in ac_est, broader "establishment period" where forests cannot be harvested.

## Interface Parameters

### Provided to Other Modules

#### 1. im_forest_ageclass(j,ac) - Forest area by age-class

**Declaration**: Parameter (declarations.gms:9)

**Unit**: Million hectares (Mha)

**Dimensions**:
- `j` - Simulation cells (~200 cells at typical cluster resolution)
- `ac` - MAgPIE age-classes (5-year intervals: ac0, ac5, ..., acx)

**Populated**: preloop phase (preloop.gms:10-14)

**Used by**:
1. **Module 35 (Natural Vegetation)** - Secondary forest initialization
   `pot_forest_may24/preloop.gms:~150`
   `p35_secdf_ageclass(j,ac) = im_forest_ageclass(j,ac)`

   Purpose: Initialize secondary forest area distribution at model start (year 1995 or user-specified). GFAD provides historical age-class structure for natural regrowth forests.

**NOT used by Module 32 (Forestry)**: Plantations start from scratch (zero initial area), do not inherit GFAD age distribution.

#### 2. ac_est(ac) - Establishment age-classes (dynamic set)

**Declaration**: Set, defined dynamically in presolve phase (presolve.gms:9-10)

**Time-varying**: Recomputed each timestep based on m_yeardiff_forestry(t)

**Used by**:
1. **Module 32 (Forestry)** - Plantation dynamics
   `dynamic_may24/presolve.gms:~280-320`

   Key uses:
   - Fix harvesting to zero: `v32_hvarea_forestry.fx(j,ac_est) = 0`
   - Fix land reduction to zero: `v32_land_reduction.fx(j,type32,ac_est) = 0`
   - Allow establishment: `v32_land.lo(j,"plant",ac_est) = 0` (unbounded)
   - Disturbance redistribution: Losses from ac_sub redistributed to ac_est

   **Rationale**: Forests planted during current timestep (ac_est) cannot be harvested within same timestep (minimum rotation constraint).

#### 3. ac_sub(ac) - Sub-rotation age-classes (dynamic set)

**Declaration**: Set, defined dynamically in presolve phase (presolve.gms:12-13)

**Time-varying**: Recomputed each timestep (complement of ac_est)

**Used by**:
1. **Module 32 (Forestry)** - Plantation dynamics
   `dynamic_may24/presolve.gms:~285-320`

   Key uses:
   - Calculate disturbance losses: `p32_disturbance_loss_ftype32(t,j,"aff",ac_sub)`
   - Allow harvesting: `v32_hvarea_forestry.fx(j,ac_sub)` unbounded (unless overridden)
   - Fix NDC afforestation: `v32_land.fx(j,"ndc",ac_sub)` (permanent protection)

   **Rationale**: Forests established in previous timesteps (ac_sub) are eligible for harvest or face natural disturbances.

## Usage by Other Modules

### 1. Module 35 (Natural Vegetation) - Secondary Forest Initialization

**Purpose**: Initialize secondary forest age-class distribution at model start

**Usage Location**: `modules/35_natveg/pot_forest_may24/preloop.gms:~150`

**Mechanism** (preloop phase, executed once at model start):
```gams
p35_secdf_ageclass(j,ac) = im_forest_ageclass(j,ac)
```

**Why GFAD matters**: Secondary forests (natural regrowth after abandonment/logging) have heterogeneous age distributions. GFAD provides realistic age structure reflecting:
- Historical deforestation-reforestation cycles
- Forest recovery trajectories
- Regional land-use history

**Without age-class data**: Would need to assume uniform age distribution or start all secondary forests at ac0 (unrealistic).

**One-time initialization**: GFAD data used only to set initial conditions (year 1995 or user-specified). Subsequent forest dynamics determined by MAgPIE optimization (Module 35 equations).

**Primary forests**: Not initialized from GFAD (handled separately via land-use history data in Module 35).

### 2. Module 32 (Forestry) - Plantation Age-Class Dynamics

**Purpose**: Define establishment vs. harvestable age-classes for plantation management

**Usage Location**: `modules/32_forestry/dynamic_may24/presolve.gms:~280-320`

**Mechanism**: ac_est and ac_sub sets control variable bounds and disturbance calculations.

#### Key Uses of ac_est (Establishment Age-Classes):

**1. Prevent premature harvesting** (presolve.gms:~280):
```gams
v32_hvarea_forestry.fx(j,ac_est) = 0
```
Cannot harvest forests planted during current timestep (minimum rotation enforcement).

**2. Prevent land reduction** (presolve.gms:~281):
```gams
v32_land_reduction.fx(j,type32,ac_est) = 0
```
Cannot abandon/convert newly established plantations within same timestep.

**3. Allow new establishment** (presolve.gms:~295):
```gams
v32_land.lo(j,"plant",ac_est) = 0
v32_land.up(j,"plant",ac_est) = Inf
```
Plantation expansion occurs in ac_est (unbounded upper bound).

**4. Disturbance redistribution** (presolve.gms:~286):
```gams
pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_est) = pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_est) +
  sum(ac_sub, p32_disturbance_loss_ftype32(t,j,"aff",ac_sub)) / card(ac_est2)
```
Forest area lost to disturbances in older age-classes (ac_sub) redistributed equally across establishment age-classes (simulates regrowth).

#### Key Uses of ac_sub (Sub-Rotation Age-Classes):

**1. Calculate disturbance losses** (presolve.gms:~285):
```gams
p32_disturbance_loss_ftype32(t,j,"aff",ac_sub) =
  pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_sub) * f32_forest_shock(t,"%c32_shock_scenario%") * m_timestep_length
```
Forest shocks (fires, storms, pests) applied only to older forests (ac_sub), not newly established (ac_est).

**2. Subtract disturbance losses** (presolve.gms:~287):
```gams
pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_sub) = pc32_land(j,"aff",ac_sub) -
  p32_disturbance_loss_ftype32(t,j,"aff",ac_sub)
```
Reduce forest area in affected age-classes.

**3. Fix NDC afforestation** (presolve.gms:~300):
```gams
v32_land.fx(j,"ndc",ac_sub) = pc32_land(j,"ndc",ac_sub)
```
NDC-committed afforestation areas fixed in ac_sub (permanent protection), only ac_est allowed to vary (new commitments).

**4. Allow harvesting** (presolve.gms:~290):
```gams
v32_hvarea_forestry.fx(j,ac_sub) = 0  [conditional, depends on harvest age]
```
Harvesting permitted in ac_sub age-classes that exceed rotation age (Module 32 logic).

## Participates In

### Conservation Laws

**All Conservation Laws**: ❌ **DOES NOT PARTICIPATE** (pure data provider module)

Module 28 is a **reference data module** with zero equations and zero optimization variables. It provides age-class definitions used by other modules but does not directly affect any conservation laws:

- **Land Balance**: ❌ Does NOT participate (provides age-class structure, not land amounts)
- **Water Balance**: ❌ Does NOT participate (no water-related parameters)
- **Carbon Balance**: ⚠️ **INDIRECT** - Age-classes used in Module 52 carbon growth calculations
  - Chapman-Richards vegetation growth uses `ac` (age-class set) for carbon density progression
  - Carbon stocks vary by age: `pm_carbon_density_ac(t,j,ac,ag_pools)`
  - Module 28 provides the age-class indexing structure
  - **Reference**: `cross_module/carbon_balance_conservation.md` (Section 6, Chapman-Richards Growth)
- **Food Balance**: ❌ Does NOT participate (age-classes don't affect production directly)
- **Nitrogen**: ❌ Does NOT participate (no nitrogen parameters)

**Key Insight**: Module 28 is **infrastructure only** - it defines the temporal structure (age-classes) that other modules use for carbon dynamics and forest management, but it has no behavioral equations itself.

---

### Dependency Chains

**Centrality Rank**: ~25 of 46 modules (low centrality)
**Total Connections**: 3 (provides to 3 modules, depends on 0)
**Hub Type**: **Pure Data Provider** (single realization, no equations, no optimization)

**Provides To** (3 modules):
1. **Module 35 (NatVeg)** - Forest age-class distribution (`ac`, `ac_sub`)
2. **Module 32 (Forestry)** - Age-class definitions for plantation rotation (`ac_est`, `ac_sub`)
3. **Module 52 (Carbon)** - Age-class index for carbon density lookups (`ac`, `ac_sub`)

**Depends On**: ZERO modules (pure input data from GFAD)

**Key Position**: Module 28 is a **foundational data module** that provides temporal granularity for forest age tracking. All forestry-related dynamics depend on this age-class structure.

**Data Source**: Global Forest Age Dataset (GFAD v1.1)
- Original: 10-year age-classes
- MAgPIE: Remapped to 5-year age-classes (ac1...ac15)
- Plus dynamic sets: ac_sub, ac_est, ac_ff

**Reference**: `core_docs/Phase2_Module_Dependencies.md` (Section 4, Pure Source Modules)

---

### Circular Dependencies

**Participates In**: ZERO circular dependency cycles

**Why NO Circular Dependencies**:
1. **Pure data provider**: No optimization variables (`vm_*`), only sets and parameters
2. **Single realization**: Only `oct24` realization exists (no algorithmic variation)
3. **Static data**: Age-class definitions loaded once, never updated during model run
4. **One-way information flow**: Provides age-class structure → other modules use it → no feedback

**Module Type**: **Acyclic Source Node** in dependency graph

**Testing**: Not applicable (no equations to test)

---

### Modification Safety

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW RISK**

**Safe Modifications**:
- ✅ Changing age-class granularity (e.g., 1-year instead of 5-year classes)
- ✅ Updating GFAD input data with newer forest age observations
- ✅ Modifying dynamic age-class sets (`ac_sub`, `ac_est`, `ac_ff`) generation logic
- ✅ Adding new age-class categories for specific analyses
- ✅ Changing the number of age-classes (currently 15 classes covering 0-75+ years)

**Dangerous Modifications**:
- ⚠️ Removing age-class sets → breaks Modules 32, 35, 52 (compilation errors)
- ⚠️ Changing set names (`ac`, `ac_sub`, etc.) → breaks all dependent modules
- ⚠️ Making age-classes inconsistent with carbon density data → Module 52 indexing errors

**Required Testing** (for ANY modification):
1. **Compilation Check**:
   - Verify all dependent modules compile without errors
   - Check that `ac`, `ac_sub`, `ac_est` sets are properly defined

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure new age-class data covers all spatial cells
   - Verify age-class distributions sum to correct totals (if using shares)
   - Check that maximum age-class matches carbon density data range

3. **Dependent Module Validation**:
   - **Module 32 (Forestry)**: Verify rotation ages map to new age-classes correctly
   - **Module 35 (NatVeg)**: Verify forest distribution initializes without errors
   - **Module 52 (Carbon)**: Verify carbon densities index correctly by age-class

**Common Issues**:
- **Index mismatch**: Carbon density data has different age-classes than Module 28 → align data ranges
- **Missing age-classes**: New forest areas assigned to undefined age-class → extend ac set
- **Dynamic set errors**: `ac_sub` or `ac_est` empty → check conditional logic in sets.gms

**Why Low Risk**: Module 28 has **zero behavioral impact** - it only provides reference data. Modifications cannot violate conservation laws or create circular dependencies. Worst-case scenario is compilation error (easily detected).

**Reference**: Data provider modules in `core_docs/Phase1_Core_Architecture.md` (Section 4.3)

## Implementation Details

### Data Loading and Transformation

**Step 1**: Load GFAD data (input.gms:8-12)
```gams
table f28_forestageclasses(j,ac_gfad) Forest area in 15 10-year age classes from GFAD (Mha)
$ondelim
$include "./modules/28_ageclass/input/forestageclasses.cs3"
$offdelim
```

**Step 2**: Initialize to zero (preloop.gms:10)
```gams
im_forest_ageclass(j,ac) = 0
```

**Step 3**: Map and split 10-year GFAD classes to 5-year MAgPIE classes (preloop.gms:11)
```gams
im_forest_ageclass(j,ac) = sum(ac_gfad_to_ac(ac_gfad,ac), f28_forestageclasses(j,ac_gfad)) / 2
```

**Logic**: Each GFAD class (e.g., class1 = 0-10 years) splits into two MAgPIE classes (ac5 = 0-5 years, ac10 = 5-10 years) with equal area (÷2).

**Assumption**: Uniform distribution within each 10-year GFAD class. Real forests may have non-uniform age distribution (e.g., more 0-5 than 5-10), but data unavailable.

**Step 4**: Handle oldest age-class (preloop.gms:14)
```gams
im_forest_ageclass(j,"acx") = f28_forestageclasses(j,"class15")
```

class15 (140+ years, including primary) maps directly to `acx` without splitting. Represents **mature forests** with stable age structure.

### Dynamic Set Calculation

**Step 1**: Clear previous timestep definitions (presolve.gms:9, 12)
```gams
ac_est(ac) = no
ac_sub(ac) = no
```

**Step 2**: Redefine based on current timestep length (presolve.gms:10, 13)
```gams
ac_est(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) <= (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))
ac_sub(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) > (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))
```

**Timestep dependency**: ac_est/ac_sub boundaries shift with varying timestep lengths.

**Macro m_yeardiff_forestry(t)** (core/macros.gms):
```gams
m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = 5$(ord(t)=1) + (m_year(t)-m_year(t-1))$(ord(t)>1)
```

**First timestep**: Always 5 years (initialization period)
**Subsequent timesteps**: Actual year difference between timesteps

**Illustrative timestep scenarios** (made-up for clarity):

**Scenario A: Uniform 5-year timesteps**
- m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = 5 for all t
- ac_est = {ac0, ac5} (0-5 years)
- ac_sub = {ac10, ac15, ..., acx} (10+ years)

**Scenario B: Uniform 10-year timesteps**
- m_yeardiff_forestry(t) = 10 for all t
- ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10} (0-10 years)
- ac_sub = {ac15, ac20, ..., acx} (15+ years)

**Scenario C: Variable timesteps (5, 10, 10, 20 years)**
- t=1: m_yeardiff_forestry = 5 → ac_est = {ac0, ac5}
- t=2: m_yeardiff_forestry = 10 → ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10}
- t=3: m_yeardiff_forestry = 10 → ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10}
- t=4: m_yeardiff_forestry = 20 → ac_est = {ac0, ac5, ac10, ac15, ac20}

**Consequence of longer timesteps**: Broader establishment period means:
- More age-classes protected from harvest (larger ac_est)
- Effective minimum rotation age increases
- Less flexibility in short-rotation plantation management

---

## Limitations

### 1. **Historical Snapshot Only (circa 2000)** (realization.gms:9)

**What's provided**: Forest age distribution circa 2000 from GFAD v1.1

**What's missing**:
- Age distribution changes 2000-present (~25 years)
- Initial conditions don't reflect current (2020s) forest age structure

**Consequence**: Model initialized with outdated age distribution. Regions with significant forest change 2000-2020 (e.g., rapid plantation expansion in Southeast Asia, deforestation in Amazon) start from non-representative baseline.

**Workaround**: MAgPIE can use more recent start year (e.g., 2010, 2015) but still uses 2000 GFAD data → mismatch between start year and age-class data.

### 2. **No Future Age-Class Projections**

**What's provided**: Single snapshot (circa 2000)

**What's missing**:
- Projected forest age trajectories under different scenarios
- Age-class evolution 2000→start year

**Consequence**: Gap between GFAD year (2000) and simulation start year (often 2015-2020) bridged by assuming **no age-class change**, unrealistic if substantial forest dynamics occurred.

### 3. **Disturbance-Affected Young Age-Classes** (realization.gms:11-14)

**GFAD characteristic**: Likely includes forests disturbed by fires, storms, logging in young age-classes (ac_young: 0-30 years).

**MAgPIE limitation**: Does not model forest disturbances extensively (no fire module, simplified storm/pest losses).

**Potential bias**: Young age-class areas may be **overestimated** if GFAD includes temporary forest openings (fire-killed stands that will regrow) that MAgPIE interprets as permanent young forests.

**Example issue**: Post-fire stand with 10% canopy cover classified as "10-year regrowth" in GFAD, but MAgPIE treats as viable 10-year forest with full carbon/timber potential.

**Consequence**:
- Overestimated young secondary forest area
- Underestimated mature forest area
- Biased carbon stock estimates in young age-classes

**Magnitude**: Uncertain, depends on regional disturbance regimes and GFAD classification algorithms.

### 4. **Uniform Age Distribution Within GFAD Classes**

**Transformation assumption**: Each 10-year GFAD class splits equally into two 5-year MAgPIE classes (÷2).

**Reality**: Age distribution within 10-year class likely non-uniform (e.g., more 0-5 year forests than 5-10 due to recent deforestation).

**Consequence**:
- Smoothing of real age-class structure
- Loss of information about age-class peaks
- Potentially misallocates forest area between adjacent 5-year classes

**Example**: If GFAD class1 (0-10 years) has 80% in 0-5 years and 20% in 5-10 years, MAgPIE assumes 50/50 split.

**Impact**: Minor for most applications (5-year resolution sufficient), but matters for precise carbon accounting in young forests.

### 5. **No Plantation vs. Natural Forest Distinction**

**GFAD data**: Includes both planted and naturally regenerated forests, undifferentiated.

**MAgPIE structure**: Separate plantation (Module 32) and natural vegetation (Module 35) modules.

**Usage**: GFAD data used **only for natural vegetation** (Module 35), **not plantations** (Module 32).

**Consequence**: If GFAD includes substantial plantation area (e.g., industrial eucalyptus in Brazil, rubber in Southeast Asia), that area incorrectly initialized as "secondary forest" in Module 35.

**Workaround**: Modules 32 and 35 adjust areas during model run, but initial conditions biased.

**Magnitude**: Significant in plantation-dominated regions (e.g., southern Brazil, Indonesia), minor in regions with primarily natural forests.

### 6. **Spatial Aggregation to Cluster Level**

**Original resolution**: GFAD 0.5° × 0.5° (~50 km at equator)

**MAgPIE resolution**: Cluster level (~200 cells, typical cell size 500-1000 km)

**Aggregation method**: Area-weighted averaging of age-class distributions

**Information loss**:
- Within-cell age-class heterogeneity smoothed out
- Localized young forest concentrations (e.g., around logging fronts) averaged away
- Sharp age-class boundaries (e.g., plantation vs. natural forest interface) blurred

**Consequence**: Cell-level age-class distributions are **spatially averaged composites**, not representative of any specific 0.5° pixel within cell.

**Impact**: Acceptable for regional/global analysis, problematic for fine-scale forest management scenarios.

### 7. **Class15 (140+ years) Aggregation**

**GFAD class15**: All forests ≥140 years old, including:
- 140-200 year old managed forests
- 200-500 year old old-growth forests
- 500+ year old primary forests

**MAgPIE treatment**: All mapped to single age-class `acx`, undifferentiated.

**Consequence**:
- Cannot distinguish old-growth from younger mature forests
- Carbon density parameterization for `acx` is weighted average across wide age range
- Primary forest dynamics simplified

**Limitation**: Matters for old-growth conservation, carbon storage in ancient forests, but GFAD resolution insufficient to distinguish anyway.

### 8. **Static Age-Class Data in Dynamic Model**

**GFAD usage**: One-time initialization in preloop (Module 35)

**Model dynamics**: Age-class distributions evolve via Module 32/35 equations during simulation

**Inconsistency**: Future age-class dynamics (2020-2100) not constrained by GFAD trajectories, only initial conditions.

**Consequence**: If GFAD shows aging trend (e.g., increasing old-growth area), MAgPIE doesn't inherit that trend, only starting point.

**Not a bug**: By design - MAgPIE optimizes future forest age structure, GFAD provides realistic initial conditions only.

### 9. **No Uncertainty Quantification**

**GFAD errors**: Forest age estimation from satellites has substantial uncertainty (±10-20 years typical).

**MAgPIE treatment**: Uses GFAD as deterministic truth, no uncertainty propagation.

**Consequence**:
- Cannot assess sensitivity to age-class initialization errors
- No probabilistic age-class distributions
- Underestimates model output uncertainty

**Workaround**: Could run sensitivity analysis with perturbed GFAD data, but not standard practice.

### 10. **ac_est/ac_sub Timestep Dependence**

**Dynamic sets**: ac_est and ac_sub boundaries change with timestep length.

**Problem**: Longer timesteps (10-20 years) create very broad ac_est (many age-classes), effectively imposing longer minimum rotation ages.

**Example**:
- 5-year timesteps: ac_est = 2 classes (0-10 years) → minimum rotation ~10 years
- 20-year timesteps: ac_est = 4 classes (0-20 years) → minimum rotation ~20 years

**Consequence**: Timestep length affects plantation management flexibility, not just computational efficiency.

**Implication**: Results from 5-year vs. 10-year timestep runs may differ in plantation dynamics, not purely due to temporal resolution but also due to age-class management constraints.

**Mitigation**: Use consistent timestep structure across scenarios, avoid mixing timestep lengths in comparisons.

## Quick Reference

### Module Role
- **Type**: Pure data provider (0 equations, 0 variables)
- **Function**: Provide forest age-class distribution for secondary forest initialization and plantation dynamics
- **Realization**: `oct24` (only option)
- **Complexity**: Simple (data loading + set manipulation)

### Key Interfaces
- **im_forest_ageclass(j,ac)** - Forest area by 5-year age-class (Mha), used by Module 35
- **ac_est(ac)** - Establishment age-classes (dynamic set), used by Module 32
- **ac_sub(ac)** - Sub-rotation age-classes (dynamic set), used by Module 32

### Age-Class Structure
- **15 GFAD classes**: class1-class15 (10-year bands, class15 is 140+ years)
- **MAgPIE mapping**: 2:1 split (each GFAD class → two 5-year classes), except class15 → acx
- **Young age-classes**: ac_young = {ac0, ac5, ac10, ac15, ac20, ac25, ac30} (0-30 years)

### Data Source
- **Dataset**: GFAD v1.1 (Poulter et al. 2019)
- **Period**: Circa 2000
- **Resolution**: 0.5° → cluster level (~200 cells)
- **URL**: https://daac.ornl.gov/CMS/guides/CMS_Global_Forest_Age_2000.html

### Dependencies
- **Upstream**: None (Module 28 reads external data only)
- **Downstream**: Module 35 (Natural Vegetation), Module 32 (Forestry)

### Key Limitations
1. **Historical snapshot** (circa 2000, no updates)
2. **Disturbance-affected young classes** (potential overestimation)
3. **Uniform age distribution assumption** (within 10-year GFAD classes)
4. **No plantation/natural distinction** (all forests mixed in GFAD)
5. **Timestep-dependent dynamics** (ac_est/ac_sub change with timestep length)

### Dynamic Set Logic
```gams
ac_est(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) <= (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))  ! Establishment age-classes
ac_sub(ac) = yes$(ord(ac) > (m_yeardiff_forestry(t)/5))   ! Sub-rotation age-classes
```

**Interpretation**:
- **ac_est**: Cannot be harvested (minimum rotation enforcement)
- **ac_sub**: Can be harvested, face disturbances, or fixed (NDC)
