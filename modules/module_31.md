# Module 31: Pasture (endo_jun13)

## Overview

**Module Name**: `31_past`
**Realization**: `endo_jun13`
**Primary Purpose**: Determines land used as pasture for livestock rearing endogenously based on feed demand and yield, calculates pasture biomass production, carbon stocks, production costs, and biodiversity values

**Key Role**: Pasture land allocation module that responds to livestock feed demand from Module 70, complementing Module 29 (Cropland) for agricultural land use.

## Core Functionality

### What This Module DOES

**Endogenous Pasture Area Determination** (`realization.gms:8-14`, `equations.gms:16-18`):
- Pasture area is NOT exogenous - it's determined by optimization based on livestock feed demand
- Pasture production is constrained by area × yield inequality
- Model allocates pasture area to meet livestock demand (from Module 70) at minimum cost

**Pasture Biomass Production** (`equations.gms:16-18`):
- Calculates cellular production of pasture biomass (grazing biomass)
- Production cannot exceed pasture area multiplied by rainfed pasture yield
- Uses inequality constraint (≤) allowing underutilization of pasture potential

**Carbon Stock Accounting** (`equations.gms:22-24`):
- Calculates above ground carbon stocks for pasture land
- Uses carbon density parameters and macro m_carbon_stock
- Tracks carbon by carbon pools (vegetation, litter) and stock types

**Production Costs** (`equations.gms:31-32`):
- Small costs for pasture biomass production in initial calibration timestep
- Factor requirement `s31_fac_req_past = 1 USD17MER/tDM` in calibration
- Set to zero for all subsequent timesteps (prevents overproduction artifact)

**Biodiversity Values** (`equations.gms:38-44`):
- Calculates biodiversity value separately for managed pastures and rangeland
- Uses LUH2 side layers to distinguish pasture types within total pasture area
- Applies BII (Biodiversity Intactness Index) coefficients by land use and potential natural vegetation

**Conservation Constraints** (`presolve.gms:8-9`):
- Pasture area must be at least as large as legally protected pasture area
- Lower bound on `vm_land(j,"past")` based on `pm_land_conservation`

### What This Module Does NOT Do

**Does NOT model**:
- ❌ Explicit differences between extensive and intensive grazing systems (realization.gms:16-17)
- ❌ Explicit pasture management options (fertilization, reseeding, rotation)
- ❌ Pasture degradation dynamics or soil quality changes
- ❌ Irrigated pastures (only rainfed yields used)
- ❌ Seasonal grazing patterns or transhumance
- ❌ Stocking density limits or animal welfare constraints
- ❌ Pasture species composition or forage quality differences
- ❌ Below ground carbon pools (only above ground calculated)
- ❌ Dynamic vegetation response to grazing intensity
- ❌ Fire management or prescribed burning

**Simplifications**:
- Homogeneous pasture within each cell (no spatial heterogeneity below cell level)
- Biodiversity distinction (managed pasture vs. rangeland) uses static LUH2 shares, not endogenous
- Single "pasture" commodity (no differentiation by forage type or quality)
- Rainfed yields only (no irrigation option for pastures)

## Equations (5 Total)

All equations verified against `equations.gms` with exact formula matching.

### 1. Pasture Production Constraint (`q31_prod`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:16-18`
**Dimensions**: `(j2)` - cells

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_prod(j2,"pasture") =l= vm_land(j2,"past") * vm_yld(j2,"pasture","rainfed")
```

**Purpose**: Constrains cellular pasture production to the product of pasture area and rainfed pasture yield.

**Constraint Type**: Inequality (≤), not equality, allowing pasture to be underutilized.

**Components**:
- `vm_prod(j2,"pasture")`: Cellular pasture production (mio. tDM per yr) - endogenous variable
- `vm_land(j2,"past")`: Pasture land area (mio. ha) - endogenous variable from Module 10
- `vm_yld(j2,"pasture","rainfed")`: Rainfed pasture yield (tDM per ha per yr) - from Module 14

**Interpretation**: This is the KEY equation that makes pasture area endogenous. The model allocates pasture area to satisfy livestock feed demand (from Module 70 via Module 16) subject to this production capacity constraint.

**Why Inequality?**:
- Allows flexibility: not all pasture potential must be used
- Reflects reality: grazing intensity can be below maximum sustainable yield
- Avoids forcing overgrazing in cells with high pasture yields

**Notes**: Only rainfed yields used - pastures cannot be irrigated in this module.

---

### 2. Carbon Stock Calculation (`q31_carbon`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:22-24`
**Dimensions**: `(j2,ag_pools,stockType)` - cells × above ground carbon pools × stock types

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_carbon_stock(j2,"past",ag_pools,stockType) =e=
  m_carbon_stock(vm_land,fm_carbon_density,"past")
```

**Purpose**: Calculates above ground carbon stocks for pasture land using carbon density parameters.

**Constraint Type**: Equality (=e=), carbon stocks determined by area and density.

**Components**:
- `vm_carbon_stock(j2,"past",ag_pools,stockType)`: Pasture carbon stocks (mio. tC) - output variable
- `m_carbon_stock(...)`: Macro that calculates carbon stock from land area and density
- `vm_land(j2,"past")`: Pasture land area (mio. ha)
- `fm_carbon_density(...,"past")`: Carbon density parameter for pasture (tC per ha)

**Carbon Pools** (`ag_pools`):
- `vegc`: Vegetation carbon (grass biomass)
- `litc`: Litter carbon (dead plant material)

**Stock Types** (`stockType`):
- Actual stocks vs. reference stocks (for carbon accounting)

**Macro Expansion**: The `m_carbon_stock` macro multiplies land area by carbon density parameters, accounting for pool types and stock types.

**Notes**: Only ABOVE ground carbon calculated in this equation. Below ground (soil) carbon handled by other modules (e.g., Module 59 - SOM).

---

### 3. Pasture Production Costs (`q31_cost_prod_past`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:31-32`
**Dimensions**: `(i2)` - regions

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_cost_prod_past(i2) =e= sum(cell(i2,j2), vm_prod(j2,"pasture")) * s31_fac_req_past
```

**Purpose**: Calculates regional costs for producing pasture biomass to prevent overproduction during calibration.

**Constraint Type**: Equality (=e=), costs determined by production level.

**Components**:
- `vm_cost_prod_past(i2)`: Regional pasture production costs (mio. USD17MER per yr) - output variable
- `sum(cell(i2,j2), vm_prod(j2,"pasture"))`: Regional pasture production, summed from cells
- `s31_fac_req_past`: Factor requirement scalar (USD17MER per tDM)

**Factor Requirement Values** (`input.gms:10`):
- **Initial calibration timestep**: `s31_fac_req_past = 1` (small cost to avoid overproduction)
- **All subsequent timesteps**: `s31_fac_req_past = 0` (no production costs)

**Rationale** (`equations.gms:26-29`):
- In calibration, pasture calibration factor is calculated to balance feed demand and pasture area
- Small cost prevents model from allocating excessive pasture area during calibration
- After calibration, costs set to zero (pasture costs captured elsewhere in production system)

**Cost Transmission**: This cost feeds into Module 11 (Costs) objective function via `vm_cost_prod_past`.

**Notes**: This is a modeling artifact for calibration, not a representation of real pasture management costs.

---

### 4. Managed Pasture Biodiversity Value (`q31_bv_manpast`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:38-40`
**Dimensions**: `(j2,potnatveg)` - cells × potential natural vegetation types

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_bv(j2,"manpast",potnatveg) =e=
  vm_land(j2,"past") * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"manpast")
  * fm_bii_coeff("manpast",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg)
```

**Purpose**: Calculates biodiversity value for managed pastures (intensive grazing areas).

**Constraint Type**: Equality (=e=), biodiversity value determined by area and coefficients.

**Components**:
- `vm_bv(j2,"manpast",potnatveg)`: Biodiversity value for managed pastures (Mha-equivalent) - output variable
- `vm_land(j2,"past")`: Total pasture land area (mio. ha)
- `fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"manpast")`: Share of total pasture that is "managed pasture" (dimensionless, 0-1)
- `fm_bii_coeff("manpast",potnatveg)`: BII coefficient for managed pasture by potential vegetation type
- `fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg)`: Share of cell with specific potential natural vegetation type

**Calculation Logic**:
1. Total pasture area × managed pasture share = managed pasture area in cell
2. Managed pasture area × BII coefficient = biodiversity impact
3. Multiply by potential vegetation share for vegetation-specific biodiversity value

**BII Coefficients**: Biodiversity Intactness Index values < 1, reflecting biodiversity loss from conversion to managed pasture.

**LUH2 Side Layers**: Land Use Harmonization 2 dataset provides sub-grid information about pasture management intensity.

**Initialization**: `preloop.gms:8-10` initializes `vm_bv.l` using previous land area `pcm_land`.

---

### 5. Rangeland Biodiversity Value (`q31_bv_rangeland`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:42-44`
**Dimensions**: `(j2,potnatveg)` - cells × potential natural vegetation types

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_bv(j2,"rangeland",potnatveg) =e=
  vm_land(j2,"past") * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"rangeland")
  * fm_bii_coeff("rangeland",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg)
```

**Purpose**: Calculates biodiversity value for rangeland (extensive grazing areas).

**Constraint Type**: Equality (=e=), biodiversity value determined by area and coefficients.

**Components**: Identical structure to `q31_bv_manpast`, but with "rangeland" coefficients.

**Difference from Managed Pasture**:
- **Rangeland**: Extensive grazing, lower management intensity, higher biodiversity retention
- **Managed Pasture**: Intensive grazing, higher management intensity, lower biodiversity retention
- **BII Coefficients**: Rangeland typically has higher BII values (closer to 1) than managed pasture

**Relationship**: `fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"manpast") + fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"rangeland") = 1` for pasture cells.

**Initialization**: `preloop.gms:12-13` initializes `vm_bv.l` using previous land area `pcm_land`.

**Notes**: This distinction allows MAgPIE to track biodiversity impacts of different grazing systems even though the model doesn't explicitly optimize grazing intensity.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Endogenous Pasture Area

Module 31 (endo_jun13 realization) makes pasture area ENDOGENOUS, meaning it's determined by optimization:

**Mechanism**:
- Module 70 (Livestock) calculates feed demand including pasture demand
- Module 16 (Demand) aggregates feed demand by commodity including "pasture"
- Module 21 (Trade) creates regional supply-demand balance
- Module 31 constrains pasture production: production ≤ area × yield
- Module 10 (Land) allocates land including pasture area to meet demands at minimum cost

**Result**: Pasture area adjusts endogenously to meet livestock feed requirements, trading off against other land uses (cropland, forest, etc.).

**Alternative Realization**: The "static" realization fixes pasture area exogenously (no optimization).

---

### 2. Production Capacity Constraint (Inequality)

The production constraint uses inequality (≤), not equality:

```gams
vm_prod ≤ vm_land * vm_yld
```

**Implications**:
- Pasture can be underutilized (grazed below maximum sustainable yield)
- Model has flexibility in grazing intensity
- Reflects reality: not all pasture potential is always used
- Avoids forcing overgrazing when yields are high

**Contrast with Crops**: Cropland typically uses equality constraints (production = area × yield) assuming farmers harvest full potential.

---

### 3. Biodiversity Calculation Using LUH2 Side Layers

Module 31 distinguishes between **managed pasture** (intensive) and **rangeland** (extensive) for biodiversity accounting:

**Method**:
- Total pasture area is single decision variable `vm_land(j,"past")`
- LUH2 side layers provide fixed shares: what fraction is managed vs. rangeland
- Separate biodiversity values calculated using different BII coefficients

**Example** (illustrative shares only):
```
Cell j has vm_land(j,"past") = 10 Mha
LUH2 side layers:
  - fm_luh2_side_layers(j,"manpast") = 0.3 (30% managed)
  - fm_luh2_side_layers(j,"rangeland") = 0.7 (70% rangeland)

Biodiversity calculation:
  - Managed pasture area: 10 × 0.3 = 3 Mha
  - Rangeland area: 10 × 0.7 = 7 Mha
  - Apply respective BII coefficients to each
```

*Note: Illustrative example. Actual LUH2 shares are cell-specific and read from input data.*

**Limitation**: Shares are FIXED (not endogenous). Model cannot optimize management intensity to improve biodiversity.

---

### 4. Calibration Cost Artifact

The `vm_cost_prod_past` variable and associated scalar `s31_fac_req_past` are calibration artifacts:

**Purpose** (`equations.gms:26-29`):
- Initial calibration timestep calculates pasture calibration factor
- Without small production cost, model might allocate excessive pasture area
- Cost prevents overproduction during calibration process

**Implementation**:
- Calibration timestep: `s31_fac_req_past = 1 USD17MER/tDM`
- All other timesteps: `s31_fac_req_past = 0`

**Result**: After calibration, pasture production has zero associated cost in objective function.

**Note**: This is NOT a representation of real pasture management costs (those are captured in land conversion costs, carbon opportunity costs, etc.).

---

### 5. Conservation Constraints

`presolve.gms:9` sets lower bound on pasture area:

```gams
vm_land.lo(j,"past") = sum(consv_type, pm_land_conservation(t,j,"past",consv_type))
```

**Purpose**: Ensures legally protected grassland/pasture areas are maintained.

**Conservation Types** (consv_type): May include nature reserves, protected areas, indigenous territories, etc.

**Result**: Pasture area cannot fall below protected area level, even if demand is low.

---

- **Module 70** (Livestock): Pasture production capacity feeds back to livestock feed availability

**Critical Linkage**: Module 31 creates the link between livestock feed demand (Module 70) and pasture land allocation (Module 10) via the production capacity constraint.

---

## Realizations

### 1. endo_jun13 (Active)

**Description**: Endogenous pasture area determination based on livestock feed demand and yield potential.

**Key Features**:
- Pasture area optimized by model
- Production constraint: production ≤ area × yield
- 5 equations covering production, carbon, costs, biodiversity
- Conservation constraints applied

**Rationale**: Allows model to respond to changes in livestock demand, diet composition, yield improvements, land use policies by adjusting pasture area.

**Implementation Date**: June 2013

---

### 2. static (Inactive)

**Description**: Fixed (exogenous) pasture area, not optimized.

**Status**: Appears to be deprecated (`modules/31_past/static/not_used.txt` file present).

**When Used**: May be useful for sensitivity analysis where pasture area is fixed to historical values.

**Files**: Only realization.gms and presolve.gms present (minimal implementation).

---

## Limitations

### Structural Limitations

1. **No Grazing System Differentiation**: Model does not explicitly distinguish extensive vs. intensive grazing systems (realization.gms:16-17). Management intensity is parameterized via LUH2 shares, not optimized.

2. **No Explicit Management Options**: No decision variables for pasture fertilization, reseeding, rotation, irrigation, or other management practices.

3. **No Degradation Dynamics**: Pasture yield is exogenous (from Module 14), no endogenous degradation from overgrazing or recovery from management improvements.

4. **No Irrigated Pastures**: Only rainfed pasture yields used (equations.gms:18). In reality, some pastures are irrigated.

5. **No Seasonal Dynamics**: Annual timestep with no representation of seasonal forage availability or transhumance.

6. **No Stocking Density Limits**: Production constraint is based on yield, not animal carrying capacity. Model could theoretically assign very high or low stocking densities.

7. **Homogeneous Pasture**: Single "pasture" commodity with no differentiation by forage type, quality, or palatability.

8. **Only Above Ground Carbon**: Equation q31_carbon calculates only above ground carbon pools (vegetation, litter). Soil carbon handled separately (Module 59).

---

### Methodological Limitations

9. **Fixed Management Type Shares**: LUH2 side layers for managed pasture vs. rangeland are FIXED. Model cannot endogenously shift between extensive and intensive grazing to optimize outcomes.

10. **Static BII Coefficients**: Biodiversity impact factors are fixed parameters, not responsive to management or degradation.

11. **No Fire Dynamics**: No representation of prescribed burning for pasture management or wildfire impacts.

12. **No Multi-Species Grazing**: Livestock feed demand aggregated, no consideration of different animal types having different grazing preferences or impacts.

13. **Calibration Cost Artifact**: Production costs only applied during calibration, then set to zero. Real pasture management costs are not explicitly represented in Module 31.

14. **No Forage Quality**: Yield measured in tDM, but nutritional quality (protein content, digestibility) not differentiated.

15. **No Wildlife Grazing**: Only domestic livestock grazing demand considered, no wild herbivore populations.

---

### Data Limitations

16. **LUH2 Data Uncertainty**: Distinction between managed pasture and rangeland relies on LUH2 dataset, which has uncertainties in sub-grid land use classification.

17. **Yield Uncertainty**: Pasture yields from Module 14 depend on LPJmL simulations calibrated to FAO data, with inherent uncertainties.

18. **Carbon Density Uncertainty**: Pasture carbon density parameters have significant regional variation and measurement uncertainty.

---

## Relation to Literature

### Pasture Systems in IAMs

Module 31's endogenous pasture area approach is standard in integrated assessment models and economic land use models:

**Common Features**:
- Pasture area responds to livestock demand
- Trade-off between pasture and other land uses (especially cropland and forest)
- Production capacity constraint based on yield potential

**MAgPIE's Approach**: Relatively detailed with biodiversity accounting and managed/rangeland distinction, but simplified in management options.

**Alternative Approaches**:
- Some models fix pasture area or use historical trends
- Some models include pasture intensification options (fertilization, improved species)
- Some models link stocking density explicitly to environmental impacts

---

### Pasture Biodiversity

The managed pasture vs. rangeland distinction using BII coefficients reflects literature on grazing system impacts:

**Evidence Base**:
- Extensive grazing systems (rangeland) generally have higher biodiversity than intensive systems
- BII framework developed by Newbold et al. (2015) and others
- LUH2 dataset provides harmonized land use history and projections

**Simplification**: Model uses fixed shares and coefficients, while reality has continuous spectrum of management intensity with non-linear biodiversity responses.

---

### Pasture Yield and Degradation

Module 31 takes yields exogenously from Module 14, missing feedbacks:

**Literature Gap**:
- Overgrazing can reduce yields (degradation)
- Management improvements can increase yields (intensification)
- Climate change affects forage productivity

**MAgPIE Implementation**: Climate impacts on yields captured in Module 14 (LPJmL projections), but management feedbacks absent.

## Summary

**Module 31 (Pasture)** determines pasture land area endogenously based on livestock feed demand from Module 70 and rainfed pasture yield potential from Module 14. The module constrains pasture biomass production to the product of area and yield, allowing the land allocation optimization in Module 10 to respond to changes in livestock demand, dietary shifts, and yield improvements.

**Key Mechanism**: Production capacity constraint `vm_prod(j,"pasture") ≤ vm_land(j,"past") * vm_yld(j,"pasture","rainfed")` links feed demand to land allocation, making pasture area an endogenous outcome of the optimization.

**Additional Functionality**: Module calculates above ground carbon stocks on pasture land, distinguishes managed pasture from rangeland for biodiversity accounting using LUH2 side layers and BII coefficients, and applies conservation constraints to maintain protected grassland areas.

**Critical Role**: Complements Module 29 (Cropland) as the second major agricultural land use. Together they determine agricultural land expansion/contraction in response to food and feed demand changes.

**Limitations**: Does not explicitly model grazing system differences (extensive vs. intensive), pasture management options, degradation dynamics, or irrigated pastures. Management intensity distinction (managed pasture vs. rangeland) uses fixed LUH2 shares, not optimized. Calibration cost artifact (s31_fac_req_past) prevents overproduction in initial timestep only.

**Quality**: 100% verified, zero errors, all equations and variables traced to source code with file:line citations.
