# Module 44: Biodiversity (bii_target)

**Realization**: `bii_target`
**File**: `modules/44_biodiversity/bii_target/`
**Authors**: Patrick v. Jeetze, Florian Humpenöder

---

## Purpose

Module 44 estimates terrestrial biodiversity stocks for all land types in MAgPIE using the **Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)** approach. The module aggregates biodiversity values calculated by land-use modules (29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35) and computes BII at the biome level. It can enforce minimum BII targets over time through a penalty cost mechanism.

**Code behavior**: The module performs two key functions:
1. **Aggregates biodiversity stocks** (`vm_bv`) from land-use modules into biome-level BII values
2. **Optionally enforces BII targets** through technical penalty costs for missing BII increases

## Core Concept

**Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)**: A relative indicator measuring the intactness of local species assemblages (species richness) compared to a reference state using a space-for-time approach. BII coefficients are based on Leclère et al. (2018, 2020).

**Spatial Resolution**: BII is calculated separately for 71 biomes (combinations of biogeographic realms and biome types, following Olson et al. 2001).

## Key Equations (3 total)

### 1. Biodiversity Intactness Index (`q44_bii`)

**Purpose**: Calculates BII at biome level by aggregating biodiversity stocks weighted by biome share.

**Formula**:
```
v44_bii(i2,biome44) =
    Σ(cell(i2,j2), landcover44, potnatveg) [vm_bv(j2,landcover44,potnatveg) × i44_biome_share(j2,biome44)]
    / i44_biome_area_reg(i2,biome44)
```

**Components**:
- `vm_bv(j,landcover44,potnatveg)`: Biodiversity stock for each land cover class (Mha), calculated by Modules 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35
- `i44_biome_share(j,biome44)`: Fraction of cell j belonging to each biome (calculated in `preloop.gms:9-11`)
- `i44_biome_area_reg(i,biome44)`: Total biome area in region i (calculated in `preloop.gms:14-15`)

**Behavior**:
- Aggregates biodiversity from cell-level land covers to regional biome-level BII
- Only calculated for biomes with non-zero area: `$(i44_biome_area_reg(i2,biome44) > 0)`
- Result is a dimensionless index (unitless ratio)

`equations.gms:13-17`

---

### 2. BII Target Constraint (`q44_bii_target`)

**Purpose**: Tracks shortfall when BII fails to meet minimum target level.

**Formula**:
```
v44_bii_missing(i2,biome44) ≥ p44_bii_target(ct,i2,biome44) - v44_bii(i2,biome44)
```

**Components**:
- `p44_bii_target(t,i,biome44)`: Time-interpolated BII target for each biome (calculated in `presolve.gms:22-42`)
- `v44_bii_missing(i,biome44)`: Technical slack variable representing BII shortfall (dimensionless)

**Behavior**:
- If BII meets target: `v44_bii_missing = 0` (no shortfall)
- If BII below target: `v44_bii_missing > 0` (shortfall incurs costs)
- This is a technical variable to maintain model feasibility when targets cannot be met

`equations.gms:22-23`

---

### 3. Biodiversity Cost (`q44_cost`)

**Purpose**: Calculates penalty costs for failing to meet BII targets.

**Formula**:
```
Σ(cell(i2,j2)) vm_cost_bv_loss(j2) = Σ(biome44) [v44_bii_missing(i2,biome44) × s44_cost_bii_missing]
```

**Components**:
- `vm_cost_bv_loss(j)`: Biodiversity penalty cost per cell (mio USD17MER), fed to Module 11 (Costs)
- `s44_cost_bii_missing`: Technical cost per unit of missing BII (default: 1e+06 USD17MER per BII unit)

**Behavior**:
- Costs accrue only when `v44_bii_missing > 0`
- High cost parameter creates strong incentive to meet BII targets
- In optimal scenarios, costs should be zero or near-zero

`equations.gms:28-29`

## Configuration Parameters

### Core Settings

| Parameter | Default | Description | Source |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `s44_bii_target` | 0 | Target BII value in target year (dimensionless) | `input.gms:9` |
| `s44_start_year` | 2030 | Year when interpolation toward BII target begins | `input.gms:12` |
| `s44_target_year` | 2100 | Year when BII target must be reached | `input.gms:11` |
| `s44_cost_bii_missing` | 1e+06 | Penalty cost per unit of missing BII (USD17MER/BII) | `input.gms:13` |
| `c44_bii_decrease` | 1 | Allow BII to decrease below current level (1=yes, 0=no) | `input.gms:10` |

**Configuration Behavior**:

**Default configuration (`s44_bii_target = 0`)**:
- No BII targets enforced
- Module simply calculates and reports BII
- No costs from `q44_cost`

**Active target scenario (e.g., `s44_bii_target = 0.7`)**:
- BII target linearly interpolated from current value (at `s44_start_year`) to 0.7 (at `s44_target_year`)
- Target remains constant after target year
- Missing BII increase incurs high penalty costs
- If `c44_bii_decrease = 0`: Target cannot fall below current BII (ratchet mechanism)

## Data Flow

### Interface Variables (Received)

Module 44 aggregates biodiversity stocks calculated by land-use modules:

| Variable | Provider Modules | Description |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| `vm_bv(j,landcover44,potnatveg)` | 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35 | Biodiversity stock for each land cover class (Mha) |

**How `vm_bv` is calculated** (examples from provider modules):

**Cropland** (Module 30, `detail_apr24`):
```
vm_bv(j,"crop_ann",potnatveg) = vm_land(j,"crop") × [crop shares] × fm_bii_coeff("crop_ann",potnatveg) × fm_luh2_side_layers(j,potnatveg)
```
`modules/30_croparea/detail_apr24/equations.gms:95`

**Pasture** (Module 31, `endo_jun13`):
```
vm_bv(j,"manpast",potnatveg) = vm_land(j,"past") × [management share] × fm_bii_coeff("manpast",potnatveg) × fm_luh2_side_layers(j,potnatveg)
```
`modules/31_past/endo_jun13/equations.gms:38`

**Natural vegetation** (Module 35, `pot_forest_may24`):
```
vm_bv(j,"primforest",potnatveg) = vm_land(j,"primforest") × fm_bii_coeff("primary",potnatveg) × fm_luh2_side_layers(j,potnatveg)
```
`modules/35_natveg/pot_forest_may24/equations.gms:56`

**General pattern**:
```
vm_bv = land_area × BII_coefficient × potential_natural_vegetation_fraction
```

### Interface Variables (Provided)

| Variable | Used by Module | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `vm_cost_bv_loss(j)` | 11 (Costs) | Biodiversity penalty cost (mio USD17MER) |
| `v44_bii(i,biome44)` | Reporting only | BII index by biome (dimensionless) |
| `vm_bv(j,landcover44,potnatveg)` | Declared here, calculated by 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35 | Biodiversity stock (Mha) |

## Input Data Files

| File | Content | Source | Reference |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| `f44_bii_coeff.cs3` | BII coefficients for each land cover × potential vegetation type | Leclère et al. 2018, 2020 | `input.gms:17-21` |
| `biorealm_biome.cs3` | Area of each biome in each simulation cell (mio. ha) | Olson et al. 2001 biomes | `input.gms:23-27` |

**BII Coefficient Structure** (`fm_bii_coeff(bii_class44,potnatveg)`):
- Dimension 1: 9 BII coefficient classes
- Dimension 2: Potential natural vegetation types (from LUH2 dataset)
- Values: Dimensionless coefficients (typically 0 to 1, where 1 = pristine biodiversity)

`input.gms:17-21`

---

## Preloop Calculations

**Biome Share Calculation** (`preloop.gms:9-11`):
```
i44_biome_share(j,biome44) = f44_biome_area(j,biome44) / Σ(biome44_2) f44_biome_area(j,biome44_2)
```
- Normalizes biome areas to fractions summing to 1 per cell
- Zero for cells with no biome data

**Regional Biome Area** (`preloop.gms:14-15`):
```
i44_biome_area_reg(i,biome44) = Σ(cell(i,j), land) [pcm_land(j,land) × i44_biome_share(j,biome44)]
```
- Aggregates biome-weighted land area to regional level
- Used as denominator in BII calculation

**Validation** (`preloop.gms:19-21`):
```
if (s44_start_year <= sm_fix_SSP2,
  abort "Start year for BII target interpolation has to be greater than sm_fix_SSP2"
);
```
- Ensures BII targets only apply in forward-looking optimization
- `sm_fix_SSP2` is the year up to which historical data is fixed

---

## Presolve Calculations

### BII Level Update (`presolve.gms:8-20`)

Updates `v44_bii.l` (level value) based on current biodiversity stocks:

```
v44_bii.l(i,biome44) =
    Σ(cell(i,j), landcover44, potnatveg) [vm_bv.l(j,landcover44,potnatveg) × i44_biome_share(j,biome44)]
    / i44_biome_area_reg(i,biome44)
```

- Fixes BII to zero for biomes with no area: `v44_bii.fx(i,biome44) = 0` if area ≤ 0
- Provides initial guess for optimization

### BII Target Interpolation (`presolve.gms:22-42`)

**Active only when** `m_year(t) = s44_start_year AND s44_bii_target > 0`

**Step 1**: Record start value
```
p44_start_value(i,biome44) = v44_bii.l(i,biome44)
```

**Step 2**: Linear interpolation from start year to target year
```
p44_bii_target(t2,i,biome44) = p44_start_value +
    [(year(t2) - s44_start_year) / (s44_target_year - s44_start_year)] × (s44_bii_target - p44_start_value)
```

**Step 3**: Constant value after target year
```
p44_bii_target(t2,i,biome44) = s44_bii_target    if year(t2) > s44_target_year
```

**Step 4**: Bounds and special cases
- Cap at 1.0: `p44_bii_target = 1` if calculated value ≥ 1
- Zero before start year: `p44_bii_target = 0` if year(t2) < s44_start_year
- Zero for biomes with no area

**Optional ratchet mechanism** (`c44_bii_decrease = 0`):
```
if (c44_bii_decrease = 0 AND v44_bii.l ≥ p44_bii_target):
    p44_bii_target = v44_bii.l    # Cannot decrease below current level
```

`presolve.gms:22-42`

---

## Postsolve Operations

**Purpose**: Record optimization results for output reporting.

**Operations**:
- Saves marginal values (shadow prices) for all variables and equations
- Saves level, upper, and lower bound values
- No calculations or updates to model state

`postsolve.gms:9-36`

---

## Model Integration

### Cost Integration

**Module 44 → Module 11 (Costs)**:
```
vm_cost_bv_loss(j)    # Biodiversity penalty costs
```

Module 11 aggregates into total regional costs:
```
vm_cost_glo = ... + Σ(j2) vm_cost_bv_loss(j2) + ...
```

**Behavior in default configuration**:
- `s44_bii_target = 0` → no penalty costs → `vm_cost_bv_loss = 0`
- BII targets active → penalty costs can be substantial if targets cannot be met

### Biodiversity Stock Calculation

**Land-use modules → Module 44**:

Each land-use module calculates `vm_bv` for its land cover classes:

| Module | Calculates `vm_bv` for |
|--------|----------------------|
| 29 (Cropland) | `crop_fallow`, `crop_tree` |
| 30 (Croparea) | `crop_ann`, `crop_per` |
| 31 (Pasture) | `manpast`, `rangeland` |
| 32 (Forestry) | `aff_ndc`, `aff_co2p`, `plant` |
| 34 (Urban) | `urban` |
| 35 (Natural vegetation) | `primforest`, `secdforest`, `other` |

Module 44 aggregates all `vm_bv` values into biome-level BII.

## Key Limitations

### 1. **Static BII Coefficients**

**What the code does**: Uses fixed coefficients from input file `f44_bii_coeff.cs3`.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT dynamically update BII coefficients based on management intensity
- Does NOT account for species-specific responses
- Does NOT model extinction dynamics or species colonization

`input.gms:17-21`

### 2. **Uniform Biome Treatment**

**What the code does**: Applies same BII calculation approach to all 71 biomes.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT account for different baseline biodiversity levels (e.g., tropical vs. temperate)
- Does NOT weight by actual species richness or endemism
- Does NOT model biome-specific ecological processes

`equations.gms:13-17`

### 3. **No Dynamic Biodiversity Processes**

**What the code does**: Calculates instantaneous BII based on current land use.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT model time lags in biodiversity loss or recovery
- Does NOT account for habitat fragmentation effects
- Does NOT model species dispersal or metapopulation dynamics
- Does NOT include genetic diversity or ecosystem function

### 4. **Simplified Forest Age Effects**

**What the code does**: Classifies secondary forests into 2 age classes (young ≤30 years, mature ≥35 years).

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT use continuous age-biodiversity relationship
- Does NOT model biodiversity accumulation curves specific to forest types
- Does NOT account for old-growth forests (>150 years) separately

`sets.gms:19-31`

### 5. **No Land-Use Intensity Gradients**

**What the code does**: Uses discrete land cover classes with fixed BII coefficients.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT model intensity gradients within managed land (e.g., low- vs. high-input agriculture)
- Does NOT account for organic vs. conventional farming
- Does NOT model agroforestry or other mixed systems separately

### 6. **Penalty Cost Approach for Targets**

**What the code does**: Uses technical penalty variable `v44_bii_missing` with high cost.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT strictly enforce BII targets as hard constraints
- Feasibility is always maintained (targets can be violated if costs are paid)
- High penalty cost may cause numerical issues in optimization

`equations.gms:22-29`

### 7. **No Species-Specific Information**

**What the code does**: Calculates aggregate BII representing average species richness.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT track individual threatened species
- Does NOT account for IUCN Red List categories
- Does NOT identify biodiversity hotspots
- Does NOT model endemism or functional diversity

### 8. **Reference State Assumptions**

**What the code does**: Uses BII coefficients from Leclère et al. (2018, 2020) based on space-for-time substitution.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT use cell-specific historical baselines
- Does NOT account for novel ecosystems
- Does NOT model shifting baselines under climate change

---

## Typical Model Runs

### Scenario 1: No Biodiversity Targets (Default)

**Configuration**:
```
s44_bii_target = 0
```

**Behavior**:
- Module calculates and reports BII for all biomes
- No penalty costs: `vm_cost_bv_loss(j) = 0`
- BII can decline freely based on land-use optimization
- No feedback from biodiversity to land-use decisions

**Use case**: Baseline scenarios, impact assessment

### Scenario 2: Moderate BII Target

**Configuration**:
```
s44_bii_target = 0.7        # Target BII = 0.7 in target year
s44_start_year = 2030       # Start increasing BII from 2030
s44_target_year = 2050      # Reach target by 2050
c44_bii_decrease = 1        # Allow decrease if needed
```

**Behavior**:
- Linear interpolation of BII target from 2030 level to 0.7 by 2050
- Model has flexibility to choose how to meet targets (land sparing, restoration, etc.)
- If targets cannot be met: `v44_bii_missing > 0` → high penalty costs
- Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and food production costs

**Use case**: Post-2020 biodiversity framework scenarios, 30x30 targets

### Scenario 3: Ratchet Mechanism (No Backsliding)

**Configuration**:
```
s44_bii_target = 0.6
s44_start_year = 2025
s44_target_year = 2100
c44_bii_decrease = 0        # Prevent BII from decreasing
```

**Behavior**:
- If current BII > target: target is set to current BII (ratchet up)
- BII cannot fall below its current level at any point
- Strong constraint on land-use expansion
- May significantly increase food production costs

**Use case**: Biodiversity safeguards, "do no harm" policies

---

## Technical Notes

### 1. Regional vs. Biome Resolution

**Code structure**:
- `vm_bv(j,...)`: Calculated at simulation cell level (0.5° grid)
- `v44_bii(i,biome44)`: Calculated at regional × biome level

**Reason**: "The regional layer is needed for compatibility with the high resolution parallel optimization output script" (`equations.gms:11`)

**Implication**: BII optimization occurs at coarser spatial scale than biodiversity stock calculation

### 2. Biome Area Weighting

**Implementation**:
```
BII = (Σ biodiversity_stocks × biome_share) / total_biome_area
```

**Effect**: Cells with larger biome area contribute more to BII

**Range-rarity weighting**: Input data `biorealm_biome.cs3` contains range-rarity weighted biome areas, giving higher weight to rare biomes (`declarations.gms:20`)

### 3. Potential Natural Vegetation Dimension

**Purpose**: `potnatveg` dimension accounts for within-cell heterogeneity in potential natural vegetation types.

**Effect**: BII coefficients vary based on what natural ecosystem the land would support:
- Tropical forest potential → different coefficient than temperate grassland potential
- Same land cover (e.g., cropland) has different biodiversity impact depending on `potnatveg`

**Source**: LUH2 potential natural vegetation layers (`fm_luh2_side_layers`)

### 4. Penalty Cost Calibration

**Default value**: `s44_cost_bii_missing = 1e+06` USD17MER per BII unit

**Interpretation**:
- 1 unit of missing BII = 1 million USD per year
- For reference: Global food system costs in MAgPIE are on order of trillions USD
- High penalty ensures BII targets are met if physically feasible
- If penalty costs appear in results: target may be infeasible or too ambitious

### 5. Time Step Length

**No explicit time step length in BII calculation**: Unlike Module 44's alternative realization `bv_btc_mar21`, which calculates biodiversity loss rates per time step, `bii_target` calculates instantaneous BII levels.

**Implication**: BII responds immediately to land-use change (no lag effects)

## Alternative Realization: `bv_btc_mar21`

**Key differences from `bii_target`**:

1. **Calculates biodiversity value loss rates** instead of BII targets:
   ```
   v44_bv_loss = (pc44_bv_weighted - v44_bv_weighted) / timestep_length
   ```
   `modules/44_biodiversity/bv_btc_mar21/equations.gms:16-18`

2. **Uses range-rarity weighting layer** (`f44_rr_layer`) to prioritize high-value areas

3. **No BII targets**: Focuses on minimizing biodiversity loss rather than meeting specific targets

4. **Cost structure**: Prices biodiversity loss rate (per time step) rather than BII shortfall

**When to use**:
- `bii_target`: For scenarios with explicit biodiversity conservation targets (e.g., Kunming-Montreal targets)
- `bv_btc_mar21`: For scenarios optimizing general biodiversity conservation without specific targets
