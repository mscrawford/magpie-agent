# Module 62: Material Demand - Technical Documentation

**Status**: Fully verified
**Realization**: exo_flexreg_apr16 (only realization)
**Equations**: 2
**Interface Variables**: 1 (vm_dem_material)

## Executive Summary

Module 62 (Material) estimates demand for non-food, non-feed, non-energy agricultural material usage based on FAO's "other utilities" category. This includes cosmetics, chemicals, textiles, and industrial uses of agricultural products (excluding bioenergy which is handled by Module 60). Material demand is exogenous: in historical periods it uses direct FAO data, in future periods it scales proportionally to food demand growth. An optional bioplastic production component can add logistic growth of bioplastic substrate demand.

**Core mechanism**:
- **Historical mode** (y1965-y2010): Material demand = FAO observed values
- **Future mode** (post-2010): Material demand = Last historical value × (Food demand ratio) + Bioplastic substrate
- **Forestry products**: Taken directly from Module 73 (Timber)

**Key insight**: Material demand is NOT optimized, it's a prescribed demand that must be satisfied (like food and feed). The module assumes material usage grows proportionally to food consumption, a simplification justified by the relatively small share of agricultural products used for non-food materials (~5-10% of total agricultural output).

### q62_dem_material: Non-Forestry Material Demand

**Location**: `equations.gms:22-30`

```gams
q62_dem_material(i2,kall_excl_kforestry) ..
    vm_dem_material(i2,kall_excl_kforestry)
    =e=
    sum(ct,f62_dem_material(ct,i2,kall_excl_kforestry))*s62_historical
    +
    (p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear(i2,kall_excl_kforestry) * p62_scaling_factor(i2))
    *(1-s62_historical) + sum(ct, p62_bioplastic_substrate(ct, i2, kall_excl_kforestry)) -
    sum(ct, p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(ct,i2,kall_excl_kforestry))
    ;
```

**Interpretation**:

**Historical mode** (s62_historical = 1, typically y1965-y2010):
```
vm_dem_material = f62_dem_material(current_year)
```
- Uses FAO observed material demand directly
- Future terms multiply by zero (1 - s62_historical = 0)
- Bioplastic substrate counted but double-counted amount subtracted (see below)

**Future mode** (s62_historical = 0, typically post-2010):
```
vm_dem_material = p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear × p62_scaling_factor + p62_bioplastic_substrate - p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted
```

Where:
- `p62_scaling_factor = current_food_demand / food_demand_lastcalibyear`
- Bioplastic substrate added
- Double-counted historical bioplastic subtracted (to avoid counting twice)

**Dimensions**:
- `i2`: Regions (typically 10-12 MAgPIE regions)
- `kall_excl_kforestry`: All commodities EXCEPT wood and woodfuel (defined in `sets.gms:17-24`)

**Units**: Million tons dry matter per year (mio. tDM/yr)

**Variables**:
- `vm_dem_material(i2,kall_excl_kforestry)`: Material demand (output positive variable) - `declarations.gms:25`
- `f62_dem_material(ct,i2,kall_excl_kforestry)`: FAO historical material demand (input parameter) - `input.gms:9-12`
- `s62_historical`: Binary switch (1 = historical period, 0 = future period) - `presolve.gms:15-19`

**Parameters**:
- `p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear(i2,kall)`: Material demand in last historical timestep (e.g., y2010) - `declarations.gms:15`
- `p62_scaling_factor(i2)`: Ratio of current food demand to last historical food demand - `presolve.gms:21-22`
- `p62_bioplastic_substrate(ct,i2,kall)`: Biomass demand for bioplastic production - `preloop.gms:30`
- `p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(ct,i2,kall)`: Amount already included in historical FAO data - `presolve.gms:26-38`

**Key mechanism**:
- **ct set** (current time): Sum over ct extracts current timestep value from time-indexed parameters
- **Switch logic**: s62_historical = 1 in historical periods, 0 in future periods (controlled in `presolve.gms:15-19`)
- **Proportional scaling**: Assumes material use per capita grows at same rate as food consumption per capita
- **Bioplastic correction**: Historical FAO data includes some bioplastic precursors, so explicit bioplastic substrate is double-counted and must be subtracted in future projections

### q62_dem_material_forestry: Forestry Material Demand

**Location**: `equations.gms:34-38`

```gams
q62_dem_material_forestry(i2,kforestry) ..
    vm_dem_material(i2,kforestry)
    =e=
    sum(ct, pm_demand_forestry(ct,i2,kforestry));
```

**Interpretation**:
- Material demand for wood and woodfuel taken directly from Module 73 (Timber)
- No scaling, no bioplastic component
- Forestry products handled separately because their demand drivers (construction, heating, paper) differ from agricultural products

**Dimensions**:
- `i2`: Regions
- `kforestry`: Forestry products (wood, woodfuel from kall set)

**Units**: Million tons dry matter per year (mio. tDM/yr)

**Variables**:
- `vm_dem_material(i2,kforestry)`: Material demand for forestry products (output) - `declarations.gms:25`
- `pm_demand_forestry(ct,i2,kforestry)`: Forestry demand from Module 73 (input parameter) - `equations.gms:37`

**Usage**: Provides timber demand to Module 16 (Demand) which aggregates with food, feed, bioenergy, and other demands to drive production optimization

---

## Key Parameters and Mechanisms

### Historical Material Demand (FAO Data)

**Parameter**: `f62_dem_material(t_all,i,kall)`
**Source**: FAO "other utilities" category (excluding bioenergy)
**File**: `modules/62_material/input/f62_dem_material.cs3`
**Citation**: `input.gms:9-12`

**FAO "other utilities" definition**:
- Cosmetics (e.g., oils for soaps, lotions)
- Chemical feedstocks (e.g., lubricants, paints, inks)
- Textiles (e.g., cotton for clothing, flax for linen)
- Industrial uses (e.g., starches for adhesives, waxes)
- **Excludes**: Bioenergy (oils for biodiesel, crops for ethanol) - handled by Module 60

**Data processing** (inferred, preprocessing done in R/madrat):
1. Extract FAO commodity balance "other util" flows
2. Remove bioenergy components (identified via Module 60 mappings)
3. Aggregate to MAgPIE commodities and regions
4. Result: Time series y1965-y2010 (historical period)

**Typical magnitudes** (illustrative, not actual data):
- Total global material demand: ~100-300 Mio tDM/yr
- Share of agricultural output: ~5-10% (much smaller than food/feed which is ~80-90%)
- Dominated by: Cotton/fibers (~40%), oils for cosmetics/chemicals (~30%), sugar/starch for industry (~20%), other (~10%)

*Note: These are illustrative proportions for pedagogy. Actual values require reading f62_dem_material.cs3 file.*

---

### Scaling Factor Calculation

**Parameter**: `p62_scaling_factor(i)`
**Location**: `presolve.gms:21-22`
**Formula**:
```gams
p62_scaling_factor(i) = sum(kfo, vm_dem_food.l(i,kfo)) / p62_dem_food_lastcalibyear(i)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Ratio of current regional food demand to last historical food demand
- If food demand doubles, material demand doubles (proportionality assumption)
- Updated every timestep based on optimized food demand from Module 15

**Example calculation** (illustrative):
- Last historical year (y2010): Food demand = 50 Mio tDM, Material demand = 5 Mio tDM
- Future year (y2030): Food demand = 75 Mio tDM (optimized by Module 15)
- Scaling factor = 75 / 50 = 1.5
- Material demand y2030 = 5 × 1.5 = 7.5 Mio tDM (+ bioplastic if active)

*Note: Numbers are illustrative for pedagogy, not from actual model runs.*

**Justification for proportionality assumption** (`realization.gms:13-14`):
- Material usage is minor compared to food/feed (~5-10% vs. ~85-90%)
- Errors in material demand projections have limited impact on land allocation
- More sophisticated modeling (income elasticities, technological change) not justified given small importance
- Acceptable for first-order global analysis

---

### Bioplastic Production System

Module 62 includes an optional bioplastic substrate demand component with three operating modes:

---

#### Mode 1: No Bioplastic (Default)

**Setting**: `s62_include_bioplastic = 0` (disabled)
**Result**: `p62_dem_bioplastic(t,i) = 0` for all future years - `preloop.gms:25-27`

---

#### Mode 2: Constant at 2020 Level

**Setting**: `s62_include_bioplastic = 1`, `s62_max_dem_bioplastic = 0` (constant)
**Result**: `p62_dem_bioplastic(t>2020,i) = f62_hist_dem_bioplastic("y2020") × (population share)` - `preloop.gms:18`

---

#### Mode 3: Logistic Growth to Target

**Setting**: `s62_include_bioplastic = 1`, `s62_max_dem_bioplastic > 0` (target set)
**Formula**: `preloop.gms:20-23`
```gams
s62_growth_rate_bioplastic = log((s62_max_dem_bioplastic/f62_hist_dem_bioplastic("y2020")) - 1)
                              / (s62_midpoint_dem_bioplastic - 2020)

p62_dem_bioplastic(t>2020,i) = s62_max_dem_bioplastic
                               / (1 + exp(-s62_growth_rate_bioplastic*(m_year(t) - s62_midpoint_dem_bioplastic)))
                               × (im_pop(t,i) / sum(i2, im_pop(t,i2)))
```

**Logistic growth parameters**:
- `s62_max_dem_bioplastic`: Global bioplastic production target (Mio tDM/yr) - default 0, user sets scenario value - `input.gms:31`
- `s62_midpoint_dem_bioplastic`: Year when production reaches 50% of maximum - default 2050 - `input.gms:32`
- `s62_growth_rate_bioplastic`: Calculated growth rate parameter (dimensionless) - `declarations.gms:11`

**Logistic function properties**:
- S-shaped curve: slow initial growth → rapid mid-century expansion → saturation at maximum
- At t = midpoint: production = 50% of maximum
- Asymptotic approach to s62_max_dem_bioplastic (never quite reaches, ~99% by midpoint + 2×(midpoint-2020))

**Regional distribution**:
- Global bioplastic demand distributed to regions proportional to population share
- Rationale: "Lack of better data" (comment in `preloop.gms:15`)
- Implicit assumption: Bioplastic production located near consumption (large populations = large production)

**Example scenario** (illustrative, made-up numbers):
- 2020 baseline: 5 Mio tDM bioplastic globally
- Target: 100 Mio tDM by 2100
- Midpoint: 2050
- Growth rate: log((100/5)-1)/(2050-2020) = log(19)/30 ≈ 0.098/yr
- 2050 production: 100/(1+exp(-0.098×0)) = 50 Mio tDM (50% of max) ✓
- 2100 production: 100/(1+exp(-0.098×50)) = ~99 Mio tDM (saturated)

*Note: Numbers are illustrative for pedagogy, not actual model parameters.*

---

### Biomass-to-Bioplastic Conversion

**Parameter**: `f62_biomass2bioplastic_conversion_ratio(kall)`
**File**: `modules/62_material/input/f62_bioplastic2biomass.csv`
**Citation**: `input.gms:14-20`

**Purpose**: Translates bioplastic final product demand (tDM bioplastic) to biomass substrate demand (tDM agricultural feedstock)

**Formula**: `preloop.gms:30`
```gams
p62_bioplastic_substrate(t,i,kall) = p62_dem_bioplastic(t,i) × f62_biomass2bioplastic_conversion_ratio(kall)
```

**Conversion ratio interpretation**:
- Ratio > 1: More biomass needed than bioplastic produced (typical case due to processing losses)
- Ratio includes: Extraction efficiency, purification losses, polymerization yield
- Commodity-specific: Different feedstocks (corn, sugarcane, oils) have different conversion efficiencies

**Typical conversion ratios** (illustrative examples, not actual data):
- Sugarcane → PLA (polylactic acid): ~1.5 tDM sugar per tDM PLA (fermentation + polymerization losses)
- Corn starch → PHB (polyhydroxybutyrate): ~2.0 tDM corn per tDM PHB (lower efficiency)
- Vegetable oils → biopolyesters: ~1.2 tDM oil per tDM polymer (higher efficiency, direct esterification)
- Lignocellulosic crops (begr, betr): ~3-4 tDM biomass per tDM bioplastic (low efficiency, requires pretreatment)

*Note: These are illustrative values for pedagogy. Actual commodity-specific ratios require reading f62_bioplastic2biomass.csv file.*

---

### Double-Counting Correction

**Problem**: Historical FAO "other utils" data (1965-2010) already includes some bioplastic precursor usage. If we add explicit bioplastic substrate in future projections scaled from historical data, we double-count the bioplastic component.

**Solution**: Calculate and subtract the double-counted amount - `presolve.gms:26-38`

**Historical period** (t_past, typically ≤ y2010):
```gams
p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(t_past,i,kall) = p62_bioplastic_substrate(t_past,i,kall)
```
- Entire bioplastic substrate is double-counted (already in FAO data)
- Subtract it: Historical material demand uses FAO directly, bioplastic substrate added, then subtracted → net effect zero (correct, avoid double-counting)

**Future period** (t > t_past, typically > y2010):
```gams
p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(t>2010,i,kall) = p62_bioplastic_substrate_lastcalibyear(i,kall) × p62_scaling_factor(i)
```
- Historical bioplastic component embedded in p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear
- When scaled by food demand ratio, historical bioplastic gets scaled too
- Must subtract this scaled historical bioplastic to avoid counting it twice when adding new bioplastic trajectory

**Exception for begr/betr** (`presolve.gms:40-45`):
```gams
p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(t,i,"begr") = 0
p62_bioplastic_substrate_double_counted(t,i,"betr") = 0
```
- Second-generation energy crops (begr, betr) did NOT exist historically (introduced for bioenergy in 2000s-2010s)
- FAO data does NOT include begr/betr material use
- Therefore NO double-counting, entire bioplastic substrate from begr/betr should be added without subtraction

**Arithmetic example** (illustrative, made-up numbers):

Historical year 2010:
- FAO material demand (including embedded bioplastic): 10 Mio tDM
- Embedded bioplastic component: 1 Mio tDM
- Equation: 10 (FAO) + 1 (bioplastic substrate) - 1 (double-counted) = 10 Mio tDM ✓ (correct, no double-counting)

Future year 2050:
- Scaled FAO material demand (10 × 1.5 food ratio): 15 Mio tDM
- Includes scaled embedded bioplastic (1 × 1.5): 1.5 Mio tDM
- New bioplastic trajectory: 5 Mio tDM (from logistic growth)
- Equation: 15 (scaled FAO) + 5 (new bioplastic) - 1.5 (double-counted scaled historical) = 18.5 Mio tDM ✓
- Breakdown: 13.5 Mio tDM non-bioplastic material (15 - 1.5) + 5 Mio tDM new bioplastic = 18.5 total ✓

*Note: Numbers are illustrative for pedagogy and arithmetic verification, not from actual model.*

- Usage: Aggregated with food, feed, bioenergy demands → total commodity demand → drives production optimization
- Relationship: Material demand is one component of total demand balance

---

### External Data Dependencies

---

## Implementation Details

### Switch Mechanism: Historical vs. Future

**Location**: `presolve.gms:15-19`

```gams
if (sum(sameas(t_past,t),1) = 1,
  s62_historical=1;
else
  s62_historical=0;
);
```

**Explanation**:
- `t_past`: Set containing historical timesteps (y1965, y1970, ..., y2010 in typical MAgPIE setup)
- `sameas(t_past,t)`: Binary indicator, 1 if current timestep t is in t_past set, 0 otherwise
- `sum(sameas(t_past,t),1) = 1`: True if t is a historical timestep
- `s62_historical = 1` in historical period, `s62_historical = 0` in future period

**Effect on equation**:
- Historical: First term active (FAO data), second term multiplies by zero
- Future: First term multiplies by zero, second term active (scaled demand)

---

### Memory Update Mechanism

**Location**: `postsolve.gms:7-16`

```gams
if (sum(sameas(t_past,t),1) = 1,
 p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear(i,kall) = f62_dem_material(t,i,kall);
 p62_dem_food_lastcalibyear(i) = sum(kfo, vm_dem_food.l(i,kfo));
);
```

**Purpose**: Store last historical year values for use in future projections

**Mechanism**:
- During historical timesteps: Overwrite "lastcalibyear" parameters with current values
- Each historical timestep updates these parameters
- Final historical timestep (y2010) values retained for all future timesteps
- Future timesteps do NOT update these parameters (condition false)

**Result**:
- `p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear`: Contains y2010 material demand
- `p62_dem_food_lastcalibyear`: Contains y2010 food demand
- Both used to calculate scaling factor in future projections

---

### Regional vs. Global Bioplastic Distribution

**Location**: `preloop.gms:17-18, 22`

**Formula**:
```gams
p62_dem_bioplastic(t,i) = [global_bioplastic_demand] × (im_pop(t,i) / sum(i2, im_pop(t,i2)))
```

**Interpretation**:
- Global bioplastic demand (from historical data or logistic curve) distributed to regions
- Distribution key: Regional population share
- Population-weighted: Large populations (China, India) get proportionally more bioplastic demand

**Assumption**: Bioplastic production/consumption correlates with population, not GDP or agricultural capacity
- Justification: "Lack of better data" (`preloop.gms:15`)
- Alternative approaches NOT implemented: GDP-weighted, land availability-weighted, crop suitability-weighted

---

### Commodity Coverage

**Non-forestry commodities** (`sets.gms:17-24`):
```
kall_excl_kforestry = {crops (tece, maiz, rice, soybean, etc.),
                       processed products (oils, sugar, fibers),
                       livestock (livst_rum, livst_pig, etc.),
                       residues (res_cereals, etc.)}
```
- 47 commodities listed (crops, processed, livestock, residues, energy crops begr/betr)
- Excludes: wood, woodfuel (handled separately by forestry equation)

**Forestry commodities**:
- `kforestry` set (defined elsewhere, typically {wood, woodfuel})
- Handled by separate equation q62_dem_material_forestry

**Rationale for separation**: Forestry products have fundamentally different demand drivers (construction, heating, paper industry) compared to agricultural products (cosmetics, textiles, chemicals), so separate modeling approaches justified

---

## Limitations and Simplifications

### 1. Proportional Scaling Assumption (Major Simplification)

**What's modeled**: Material demand grows proportionally to food demand (linear relationship, same ratio for all commodities)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Income elasticity**: Wealthier populations may use more cosmetics/chemicals per capita (higher income elasticity for material uses than food)
- **Technological substitution**: Synthetic materials replacing agricultural materials (e.g., synthetic fibers replacing cotton, petrochemical plastics reducing bioplastic demand)
- **Commodity-specific trends**: Some materials (cotton) may grow slower than food, others (bioplastics) faster
- **Saturation effects**: Material demand per capita may plateau in wealthy countries while food demand continues evolving

**Implications**:
- Underestimates material demand if income elasticity > food elasticity (typical in low-income → high-income transitions)
- Overestimates if technological substitution accelerates (petrochemical replacements)
- Misses structural shifts in material composition (cotton vs. synthetics)

**Justification** (`realization.gms:13-14`): "Simplification that can be justified by the minor importance of non-bioenergy material usage" (~5-10% of agricultural output)

---

### 2. Population-Weighted Bioplastic Distribution

**What's modeled**: Global bioplastic demand distributed to regions proportional to population share

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Production cost heterogeneity**: Some regions have lower bioplastic production costs (cheap feedstocks, existing infrastructure)
- **Trade patterns**: Bioplastic production may concentrate in low-cost regions, exported to high-demand regions
- **Policy targeting**: Some regions may have bioplastic mandates/subsidies (EU Plastics Strategy), others may not
- **Agricultural capacity**: Regions with surplus cropland more suitable for bioplastic feedstock production

**Implication**: Bioplastic feedstock demand may be concentrated in different regions than population distribution suggests (e.g., Brazil high bioplastic potential due to cheap sugarcane, despite medium population)

**Justification** (`preloop.gms:15`): "Due to lack of better data" - no regional bioplastic projections available

---

### 3. Exogenous Bioplastic Trajectory

**What's modeled**: Bioplastic demand follows prescribed logistic curve (user sets maximum and midpoint)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Price responsiveness**: Bioplastic demand does NOT respond to high feedstock prices or land scarcity
- **Technological learning**: Production costs decline over time → demand accelerates (cost curves NOT modeled)
- **Policy dynamics**: Carbon prices, plastic bans, circular economy policies affect bioplastic adoption (external to MAgPIE)
- **Petrochemical competition**: Fossil plastic price changes affect bioplastic competitiveness (oil prices NOT in Module 62)

**Implication**: Bioplastic demand trajectory insensitive to MAgPIE-endogenous variables (land prices, feedstock availability). If land is scarce and bioplastic feedstocks expensive, demand still follows prescribed curve (may be unrealistic).

---

### 4. Fixed Biomass-to-Bioplastic Conversion Ratios

**What's modeled**: Constant conversion factors (e.g., 1.5 tDM sugar per tDM PLA, fixed over time)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Technological progress**: Conversion efficiency improves over time (e.g., 1.5 → 1.2 by 2050 due to better fermentation, polymerization)
- **Feedstock quality effects**: High-quality feedstocks (pure sugars) have better yields than low-quality (lignocellulosic begr/betr)
- **Scale economies**: Large-scale biorefineries more efficient than small-scale (conversion ratios improve with production volume)
- **Multiple conversion pathways**: Different processing routes (e.g., enzymatic vs. chemical hydrolysis) have different yields

**Implication**: Overestimates feedstock demand if technology improves faster than assumed, underestimates if conversion routes are less efficient than data suggests

---

### 5. No Demand-Side Response

**What's modeled**: Material demand is exogenous, must be satisfied (like food demand in Module 15)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Price elasticity**: High material prices do NOT reduce material consumption (inelastic demand)
- **Substitution**: Consumers/industries do NOT switch to non-agricultural materials when agricultural feedstocks expensive (e.g., synthetic fibers when cotton expensive)
- **Circular economy**: Recycling of materials (e.g., cotton textiles recycled, bioplastics composted and reused) NOT captured → demand overstated

**Implication**: If land is scarce and material feedstock production costly, model may produce unrealistically high land prices rather than reducing material demand. In reality, demand would adjust downward (substitution to synthetics, recycling, efficiency improvements).

---

### 6. Aggregated "Material" Category

**What's modeled**: Single aggregate "material demand" per commodity (cosmetics + chemicals + textiles + industrial uses lumped together)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **End-use disaggregation**: Cannot distinguish cosmetics (high-value, low-volume) from industrial starches (low-value, high-volume)
- **Value chain heterogeneity**: Different end uses have different price sensitivities, substitution possibilities
- **Temporal dynamics**: Some uses grow faster (cosmetics in emerging economies) than others (industrial lubricants declining due to synthetics)

**Implication**: Cannot model end-use-specific policies (e.g., ban on microplastics in cosmetics, mandates for bio-based chemicals). All material uses treated homogeneously.

---

### 7. No Feedback to Prices or Land Allocation

**What's modeled**: Material demand → Module 16 → production optimization, but NO feedback from land scarcity to material demand

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Induced innovation**: High land prices → incentive to develop land-saving material technologies (synthetic substitutes, material efficiency)
- **Demand suppression**: Extreme land scarcity → material uses bid out of market (food prioritized, materials cut)
- **Inter-module consistency**: Module 60 (Bioenergy) similarly exogenous → combined bioenergy + material demands may exceed plausible land availability (no automatic adjustment)

**Implication**: In extreme scenarios (very high bioenergy + bioplastic demand), model may allocate unrealistic land areas to material feedstocks rather than adjusting demand downward. User must set realistic demand scenarios externally.

---

### 8. Historical FAO Data Limitations

**What's modeled**: FAO "other utilities" category as reported (assumed accurate and comprehensive)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Informal uses**: Village-level material uses (e.g., crop residues for thatching, fibers for baskets) may not be fully captured in FAO statistics
- **Reporting heterogeneity**: Different countries have different statistical capacity → data quality varies
- **Definition changes**: FAO "other util" category definition may have changed over time (1965 vs. 2010 not strictly comparable)

**Implication**: Historical baseline (y2010) may understate material demand in regions with weak statistics (Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia), leading to underestimated future projections in those regions.

---

### 9. Bioplastic Substrate Composition Fixed

**What's modeled**: Fixed composition of bioplastic feedstocks (conversion ratios by commodity from f62_bioplastic2biomass.csv)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Endogenous feedstock choice**: Model does NOT optimize which crops to use for bioplastics based on relative prices (e.g., switch from corn to sugarcane if corn expensive)
- **Regional adaptation**: All regions use same feedstock mix (may be unrealistic - Brazil favors sugarcane, US favors corn for bioplastics)
- **Technological flexibility**: New bioplastic pathways (e.g., algae, CO2-to-polymer) NOT represented

**Implication**: Bioplastic feedstock demand composition fixed exogenously. If certain feedstocks become scarce/expensive, model cannot substitute to alternative feedstocks. User must manually adjust conversion ratios for alternative scenarios.

---

### 10. No Trade in Materials

**What's modeled**: Regional material demand must be satisfied by regional production (+ trade handled implicitly in Module 21)

**What's NOT modeled** (explicitly in Module 62):
- **Material trade flows**: Cotton produced in US, exported for textiles in Asia
- **Processing trade**: Oilseeds exported, processed to cosmetic oils abroad, reimported
- **Bioplastic trade**: Bioplastic feedstocks vs. bioplastic final products trade (different value chains)

**Note**: Module 21 (Trade) handles commodity trade generally, but Module 62 does NOT specify material-specific trade policies or constraints. Material commodities traded like food/feed commodities (no special treatment).

**Implication**: Regional material demand drives regional production via trade module, but no material-specific trade barriers or regional specialization modeled (e.g., cannot represent EU bioplastic import quotas, US export restrictions on industrial cotton).

---

### 11. No Material Waste or Losses

**What's modeled**: Material demand = Material production (100% utilization)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Processing waste**: Industrial use of agricultural materials involves waste (e.g., 20% of cotton lost in textile processing)
- **Product lifetime**: Materials embodied in products (textiles, plastics) eventually discarded → demand includes replacement
- **Recycling**: Some materials recycled (cotton textiles, bioplastics) → reduces primary feedstock demand

**Implication**: Material demand overstated if waste/losses significant. FAO "other util" category may already include waste (unclear), but Module 62 does NOT explicitly model waste flows.

---

### 12. Static Historical Period (1965-2010)

**What's modeled**: Historical period fixed at y1965-y2010 (t_past set)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Historical period extension**: New FAO data (2011-2025) NOT incorporated → gap between last historical year (2010) and simulation start (often 2020)
- **Historical calibration**: Material demand in 2010-2020 gap estimated via food demand scaling (same future mechanism), may be inaccurate

**Implication**: Simulations starting in 2020 or 2025 have 10-15 year calibration gap where material demand estimated, not observed. Initial conditions (p62_dem_material_lastcalibyear) based on 2010 FAO data, not actual 2020 conditions.

## Scenario Design Considerations

### Standard Scenario (Default Settings)

**Configuration**:
- `s62_include_bioplastic = 1` (bioplastic included)
- `s62_max_dem_bioplastic = 0` (constant at 2020 level)
- Material demand scales with food demand (proportional assumption)

**Use case**: Baseline projections with modest bioplastic growth (no aggressive expansion)

---

### High Bioplastic Scenario

**Configuration**:
- `s62_include_bioplastic = 1`
- `s62_max_dem_bioplastic = 100` (example: 100 Mio tDM/yr by 2100)
- `s62_midpoint_dem_bioplastic = 2050` (rapid growth mid-century)

**Use case**: Explore land-use impacts of ambitious bioplastic substitution for fossil plastics (e.g., EU Plastics Strategy scenarios, circular bioeconomy)

**Expected effects**:
- Increased demand for sugar crops (sugarcane, sugarbeet), starch crops (corn, cassava), oil crops (rapeseed, soybean)
- Competition with food/feed for these crops → land expansion or yield intensification
- Potentially large land footprint if bioplastic demand scales to replace significant fraction of fossil plastics

---

### No Bioplastic Scenario

**Configuration**:
- `s62_include_bioplastic = 0` (bioplastic disabled)
- Material demand = traditional uses only (cosmetics, chemicals, textiles, industrial)

**Use case**: Counterfactual baseline without bioplastic expansion, or sensitivity analysis to isolate bioplastic land-use impacts

**Comparison**: (High Bioplastic - No Bioplastic) = land-use change attributable to bioplastics

---

### Slow Bioplastic Growth Scenario

**Configuration**:
- `s62_include_bioplastic = 1`
- `s62_max_dem_bioplastic = 50` (moderate target)
- `s62_midpoint_dem_bioplastic = 2080` (delayed growth, late-century expansion)

**Use case**: Conservative bioplastic adoption (technological barriers, cost competitiveness challenges, policy uncertainty)

---

### Interaction with Module 15 (Food Demand) Scenarios

**SSP scenarios** (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways):
- **SSP1** (Sustainability): Low food demand growth → low material demand scaling → modest land pressure from materials
- **SSP3** (Regional Rivalry): High population growth → high food demand → high material demand (if SSP3 also has high per-capita material use) → large land pressure
- **SSP5** (Fossil-fueled Development): High income growth → potentially high material demand (cosmetics, high-value materials in wealthy populations)

**Scenario alignment**: Material demand scenarios should align with broader SSP narratives (e.g., SSP1 may have high bioplastic substitution for sustainability, SSP5 may have low bioplastic due to cheap fossil plastics)

---

## Key Insights and Usage Notes

### 1. Material Demand is a Demand Driver, Not Optimized

Material demand (vm_dem_material) is a **positive variable** (`declarations.gms:24-26`), but it's effectively **fixed by equations** (historical FAO data or scaled projections). The optimization does NOT choose material demand levels; it takes material demand as given and determines optimal production/land allocation to satisfy it.

**Implication**: Material demand scenarios are **exogenous scenario assumptions**, not model outputs. User must set plausible demand trajectories (bioplastic targets, food demand growth) based on external analysis.

---

### 2. Bioplastic Substrate Competes with Bioenergy

Module 62 (Material) and Module 60 (Bioenergy) both create demand for agricultural products. In scenarios with high bioenergy (e.g., climate mitigation with BECCS) AND high bioplastics (circular bioeconomy), combined demands may be very large.

**Competition for feedstocks**:
- Sugar crops: Bioenergy (ethanol) vs. Bioplastic (PLA)
- Oil crops: Bioenergy (biodiesel) vs. Material (cosmetics, bioplastic)
- Lignocellulosic crops (begr, betr): Bioenergy vs. Bioplastic (cellulose-based polymers)

**Model behavior**: Both demands satisfied (no prioritization), total demand drives production → land expansion or intensification. If combined demands exceed land availability, model becomes infeasible or shadow prices explode (signal unrealistic scenario).

**Recommendation**: Bioenergy + bioplastic + food/feed demands should be checked for consistency (total demand within plausible production capacity given land constraints). Use Module 11 shadow prices to diagnose excessive demand.

---

### 3. Material Demand Scales with Food, Not Population Directly

**Key distinction**:
- Material demand (non-bioplastic) scales with **food demand** (`vm_dem_food`), not population or GDP
- Food demand itself scales with population, income, and dietary preferences (Module 15)

**Result**: Material demand growth driven by:
1. Population growth (more people → more food → more materials)
2. Dietary change (richer diets → more food demand → more materials)
3. Food waste changes (less waste → less food demand → less materials)

**Example** (illustrative):
- If population stable but diets become more animal-product-intensive → food demand increases (more feed needed) → material demand increases
- If food waste reduced 50% → food demand decreases for same calorie consumption → material demand decreases

*Note: Example is conceptual for understanding the mechanism, not from actual model runs.*

---

### 4. Forestry Material Demand Independent

Forestry products (wood, woodfuel) handled separately by Module 73 (Timber), passed directly to Module 62 without scaling. Timber demand driven by:
- Construction activity (correlated with GDP, urbanization)
- Energy demand for heating (correlated with population, climate, energy access)
- Paper industry (correlated with GDP, literacy, digitalization)

**Implication**: Forestry material demand dynamics completely different from agricultural materials. Scenarios should align timber demand (Module 73) with broader scenario narratives (e.g., high construction in SSP5, high woodfuel in SSP3 low-access regions).

---

### 5. Bioplastic Distribution by Population May Misallocate Production

Population-weighted bioplastic distribution is a **data limitation workaround**, not necessarily realistic. In reality:
- **Production concentration**: Bioplastic production likely concentrated in regions with cheap feedstocks (Brazil sugarcane, US corn) or existing chemical industry
- **Consumption concentration**: Bioplastic consumption may concentrate in wealthy regions with plastics regulations (EU, Japan)

**Model assumption**: Population-weighted = assumes production and consumption co-located, no strong trade patterns.

**Implication for land use**: May over-allocate bioplastic feedstock production to high-population regions (China, India) and under-allocate to high-potential regions (Brazil, US). Regional production patterns may be inaccurate, though global totals correct.

---

### 6. Double-Counting Correction Critical for Bioplastic Scenarios

The double-counting correction mechanism (`presolve.gms:26-38`) is essential for avoiding artificial demand inflation in bioplastic scenarios. Without this correction:
- Historical material demand (10 Mio tDM, including 1 Mio tDM bioplastic precursors)
- Scaled to future (10 × 1.5 = 15 Mio tDM, including 1.5 Mio tDM scaled bioplastic)
- New bioplastic trajectory (5 Mio tDM)
- **Without correction**: 15 + 5 = 20 Mio tDM (WRONG, 1.5 Mio tDM double-counted)
- **With correction**: 15 + 5 - 1.5 = 18.5 Mio tDM (CORRECT)

**User verification**: Check that begr/betr bioplastic substrate has zero double-counting (`presolve.gms:44-45`), as these crops did not exist historically.

---

### 7. Material Demand Share of Total Agricultural Output

Material demand is relatively **small** compared to food and feed:
- Food + Feed: ~85-90% of agricultural output
- Bioenergy: ~5-10% (varies by scenario, larger in climate mitigation scenarios)
- Material (non-bioenergy): ~5-10%

**Implication for land use**: Material demand changes have modest impact on global land use unless bioplastic demand grows very large (e.g., 100+ Mio tDM bioplastic comparable to bioenergy demand in some scenarios).

**Scenario impact hierarchy**:
1. Food demand changes (population, diets): **Large impact** on land
2. Bioenergy demand changes: **Medium-Large impact** (scenario-dependent)
3. Material demand changes (traditional): **Small impact**
4. Material demand changes (high bioplastic): **Medium impact**
