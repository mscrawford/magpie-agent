## Overview

Module 20 (Processing) transforms primary agricultural products into secondary products through various processing routes (milling, refining, extracting, distilling, fermentation, breeding, ginning) `sets.gms:20-24`. The module implements a sophisticated substitution system allowing lower-quality secondary products to be replaced by higher-quality alternatives based on nutritional content and economic cost.

**Key Insight**: The `substitution_may21` realization removes the calibration factors used in `substitution_dec18` to reduce artificial constraints on oil substitution `realization.gms:9`.

---

## Core Functionality

### 1. Processing Types

Module 20 defines 7 distinct processing activities `sets.gms:20-24`:

| Process | Primary Products | Secondary Products | Example Route |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **milling** | Cereals (tece, maiz, trce, rice_pro) | Brans, processed cereals | Wheat → Flour + Bran |
| **refining** | Sugar crops (sugr_cane, sugr_beet) | Sugar, molasses | Sugar cane → Sugar + Molasses |
| **extracting** | Oilcrops | Oils, oilcakes | Soybean → Oil + Oilcake |
| **distilling** | Cereals, sugarcane | Alcohol, ethanol, distillers grain | Maize → Ethanol + Distillers grain |
| **fermentation** | Various crops | Alcohol, SCP | Sugar → Alcohol |
| **breeding** | SCP feedstocks | Single-cell protein | Methane/Sugar → SCP |
| **ginning** | Cotton (cottn_pro) | Cotton lint, cotton seed | Seed cotton → Lint + Seed |

The 8th activity type "substitutes" represents substitution operations rather than physical processing `sets.gms:20-21`.

### 2. Processable Products

**Processable products (kpr)** `sets.gms:10-13`:
- Cereals: tece, maiz, trce, rice_pro
- Oilcrops: soybean, rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower, oilpalm
- Sugar crops: sugr_cane, sugr_beet
- Other: potato, cassav_sp, cotton (cottn_pro), begr, betr
- Secondary: brans, sugar, molasses, oils, oilcakes, foddr, others

**Non-processable products (knpr)** `sets.gms:15-18`:
- Animal products: livst_chick, livst_egg, livst_milk, livst_pig, livst_rum, fish
- Residues: res_cereals, res_fibrous, res_nonfibrous
- Other: alcohol, ethanol, distillers_grain, fibres, pasture, puls_pro, scp, wood, woodfuel, oilcakes

Non-processable products have processing demand fixed to zero `presolve.gms:9`.

## Equations (10 Total)

### Aggregation Equations (3)

#### 1. q20_processing_aggregation_nocereals `equations.gms:22-24`

**Purpose**: Aggregates processing demand for all activities except milling and ginning.

**Formula**:
```
vm_dem_processing(i2,kpr) =e=
  sum(no_milling_ginning20, v20_dem_processing(i2,no_milling_ginning20,kpr))
```

**Sets involved**:
- `no_milling_ginning20` = {refining, extracting, distilling, fermentation, breeding, substitutes} `sets.gms:29-30`

**Why separate?**: Milling and ginning are handled differently to match FAO Commodity Balance Sheet structure `equations.gms:13-14`.

#### 2. q20_processing_aggregation_cereals `equations.gms:32-33`

**Purpose**: Links cereal milling directly to food demand (FAO convention).

**Formula**:
```
vm_dem_food(i2,kcereals20) =e= v20_dem_processing(i2,"milling",kcereals20)
```

**Cereals set** `sets.gms:26-27`:
- kcereals20 = {tece, maiz, trce, rice_pro}

**Rationale**: FAO Commodity Balance Sheets do NOT count cereal milling as "processing" but derive it from food use `equations.gms:29-30`.

#### 3. q20_processing_aggregation_cotton `equations.gms:40-41`

**Purpose**: Links cotton ginning to cotton production (FAO convention).

**Formula**:
```
vm_prod_reg(i2,"cottn_pro") =e= v20_dem_processing(i2,"ginning","cottn_pro")
```

**Rationale**: FAO does not separately account for "seed cotton" → "cotton lint" + "cotton seed" transformation. MAgPIE only includes "cotton seed" as product, so lint is implicitly bound to production `equations.gms:36-38`.

---

### Main Processing Equation

#### 4. q20_processing `equations.gms:59-65`

**Purpose**: Converts primary products to secondary products using conversion factors and processing shares.

**Formula**:
```
sum(processing20, v20_dem_processing(i2,processing20,kpr)
    * sum(ct, i20_processing_conversion_factors(ct,processing20,ksd,kpr))) =e=
  (vm_prod_reg(i2,ksd) - sum(ct, f20_processing_balanceflow(ct,i2,ksd)))
    * sum(ct, i20_processing_shares(ct,i2,ksd,kpr))
    - v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,ksd,kpr)
    + vm_secondary_overproduction(i2,ksd,kpr)
```

**Left side**: Demand for primary product `kpr` multiplied by conversion efficiency to secondary product `ksd`.

**Right side components**:
1. **Regional production** of secondary product `ksd`: `vm_prod_reg(i2,ksd)`
2. **Minus balanceflow**: `f20_processing_balanceflow(ct,i2,ksd)` accounts for country-specific historical conversion efficiency differences while keeping conversion factors global `equations.gms:53-54`
3. **Times processing shares**: `i20_processing_shares(ct,i2,ksd,kpr)` indicates which fraction of secondary product `ksd` comes from primary product `kpr` `equations.gms:51-52`
4. **Minus substitutes**: `v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,ksd,kpr)` allows cheaper secondary products to be substituted by primary products or other secondary products `equations.gms:54-55`
5. **Plus overproduction**: `vm_secondary_overproduction(i2,ksd,kpr)` handles coupled products that are overproduced relative to demand `equations.gms:56-57`

**Why global conversion factors?**: To avoid path-dependencies where future projections are locked into historical regional processing patterns `equations.gms:46-48`.

**Why regional shares?**: To capture which crops are historically used for which secondary products in different regions (e.g., palm oil in tropics, rapeseed oil in Europe) `equations.gms:51-52`.

**Input files**:
- `f20_processing_conversion_factors.cs3` `input.gms:15-18`
- `f20_processing_shares.cs3` `input.gms:20-23`
- `f20_processing_balanceflow.cs3` `input.gms:10-13`

### Substitution Equations (4)

These equations enable lower-quality or overproduced secondary products to be replaced by alternatives.

#### 5. q20_processing_substitution_oils `equations.gms:68-70`

**Purpose**: Allows oils from one crop to be substituted by oils from another crop.

**Formula**:
```
v20_dem_processing(i2,"substitutes","oils") =g=
  sum(kpr, v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"oils",kpr))
```

**Enabled substitutes** `presolve.gms:15`:
- All oilcrop products can substitute for oils (upper bound = Inf)

**Example**: Palm oil shortage can be substituted by soybean oil or rapeseed oil.

#### 6. q20_processing_substitution_sugar `equations.gms:73-75`

**Purpose**: Allows molasses to be substituted by refined sugar.

**Formula**:
```
v20_dem_processing(i2,"substitutes","sugar") =g=
  sum(kpr, v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"molasses",kpr))
```

**Enabled substitutes** `presolve.gms:16`:
- Sugar can substitute for molasses (upper bound = Inf)

**Rationale**: Molasses is a lower-value byproduct of sugar refining. If molasses is in short supply, refined sugar can be used instead `equations.gms:72`.

#### 7. q20_processing_substitution_protein `equations.gms:81-89`

**Purpose**: Allows protein-rich products (oilcakes, distillers grain) to be substituted by alternatives based on nitrogen (protein) content.

**Formula**:
```
sum(oilcake_substitutes20,
    v20_dem_processing(i2,"substitutes",oilcake_substitutes20)
    * fm_attributes("nr",oilcake_substitutes20)) =g=
  sum(kpr,
    (v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"distillers_grain",kpr)
     + v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"oilcakes",kpr))
    * fm_attributes("nr",kpr))
```

**Oilcake substitutes** `sets.gms:32-33`:
- oilcake_substitutes20 = {soybean, rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower, oilpalm, cottn_pro, oilcakes}

**Key feature**: Substitution is based on **nitrogen content** (protein) rather than mass, ensuring nutritional equivalence `equations.gms:77-79`.

**Enabled substitutes** `presolve.gms:17-18`:
- Oilcrops and oilcakes can substitute for distillers grain and oilcakes (upper bound = Inf)

**Example**: Distillers grain from ethanol production can be replaced by soybean meal based on equivalent protein content.

#### 8. q20_processing_substitution_brans `equations.gms:93-97`

**Purpose**: Allows brans (cereal milling byproduct) to be substituted by whole cereals based on nitrogen content.

**Formula**:
```
sum(kcereals20, v20_dem_processing(i2,"substitutes",kcereals20)
    * fm_attributes("nr",kcereals20)) =g=
  sum(kcereals20, v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"brans",kcereals20)
    * fm_attributes("nr","brans"))
```

**Enabled substitutes** `presolve.gms:19`:
- Cereals can substitute for brans (upper bound = Inf for kcereals20 only)

**Key feature**: Protein-equivalent substitution using nitrogen content `equations.gms:91`.

**Example**: If bran is scarce, whole maize can substitute based on equivalent protein value.

---

### Cost Equations (2)

#### 9. q20_processing_costs `equations.gms:115-121`

**Purpose**: Calculates total regional processing costs including physical processing and single-cell protein (SCP) production.

**Formula**:
```
vm_cost_processing(i2) =e=
  sum((ksd,processing20,kpr), v20_dem_processing(i2,processing20,kpr)
    * sum(ct, i20_processing_conversion_factors(ct,processing20,ksd,kpr))
    * i20_processing_unitcosts(ksd,kpr))
  + (vm_prod_reg(i2,"scp")
    * sum(scptype, sum(ct, f20_scp_type_shr(scptype,"%c20_scp_type%"))
    * f20_scp_unitcosts(scptype)))
```

**Cost components**:

1. **Standard processing costs** (first term):
   - Demand for primary product × conversion factor × unit cost
   - Unit costs are route-specific: `i20_processing_unitcosts(ksd,kpr)` `input.gms:25-28`
   - Costs from literature and expert estimates `equations.gms:105-108`

2. **SCP costs** (second term):
   - Handled separately because SCP hydrogen production has no land/feedstock requirements `preloop.gms:13-16`
   - SCP processing unit costs set to zero to avoid double-counting `preloop.gms:16`
   - Scenario-dependent: c20_scp_type ∈ {mixed, methane, sugar, cellulose, hydrogen} `sets.gms:38-39`
   - Default scenario: "sugar" `input.gms:8`

**Input files**:
- `f20_processing_unitcosts.cs3` `input.gms:25-28`
- `f20_scp_unitcosts.csv` `input.gms:45-50`
- `f20_scp_type_shr.csv` `input.gms:35-38`

**Scaling**: `vm_cost_processing.scale(i) = 10e5` (1 million USD) `scaling.gms:8`

#### 10. q20_substitution_utility_loss `equations.gms:134-142`

**Purpose**: Penalizes substitution to discourage deviations from initial demand estimates, plus adjusts for oil quality differences.

**Formula**:
```
vm_processing_substitution_cost(i2) =e=
  sum(kpr, v20_dem_processing(i2,"substitutes",kpr) * 200)
  + sum((ksd,processing20,kpr), v20_dem_processing(i2,processing20,kpr)
      * sum(ct, i20_processing_conversion_factors(ct,processing20,ksd,kpr))
      * f20_quality_cost(ksd,kpr))
```

**Cost components**:

1. **Substitution penalty** (first term):
   - Flat penalty of **200 USD/tDM** for any substitution activity `equations.gms:125-126`
   - Strongly disincentivizes substitution unless necessary `equations.gms:125-126`

2. **Quality adjustment** (second term):
   - Accounts for heterogeneity among oils traded as homogeneous commodities `equations.gms:127-129`
   - Low-quality oils (palm oil) become more expensive; high-quality oils become cheaper `equations.gms:129-130`
   - Magnitude based on current price differences, standardized to soybean oil price `equations.gms:130-132`
   - Input file: `f20_quality_cost.cs3` `input.gms:30-33`

**Scaling**: `vm_processing_substitution_cost.scale(i) = 10e4` (10,000 USD) `scaling.gms:9`

**Interpretation**: This represents a **utility loss** from consuming a different product than preferred, not a market transaction cost `equations.gms:123-126`.

## Single-Cell Protein (SCP) System

Module 20 includes a sophisticated scenario system for single-cell protein (SCP) production from various substrates.

### SCP Types `sets.gms:35-36`

| SCP Type | Substrate | Land Requirement |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **scp_methane** | Methane gas | Yes (mapped to crops) |
| **scp_sugar** | Sugar crops | Yes (mapped to crops) |
| **scp_cellulose** | Cellulosic biomass | Yes (mapped to crops) |
| **scp_hydrogen** | Hydrogen | **No** (no feedstock) |

### SCP Scenarios `sets.gms:38-39`

- **mixed**: Blend of multiple SCP types
- **methane**: Pure methane-based SCP
- **sugar**: Pure sugar-based SCP (default) `input.gms:8`
- **cellulose**: Pure cellulosic-based SCP
- **hydrogen**: Pure hydrogen-based SCP

### SCP Processing Shares `preloop.gms:18-20`

```
i20_processing_shares(t_all,i,"scp",kpr) = 0
i20_processing_shares(t_all,i,"scp",kpr) = f20_scp_processing_shares(kpr,"%c20_scp_type%")
```

**Input file**: `f20_scp_processing_shares.csv` `input.gms:40-43`

**Purpose**: Maps SCP production to specific crop feedstocks depending on production route. Hydrogen-based SCP has zero processing shares (no land requirement) `preloop.gms:13-15`.

### SCP Cost Accounting `preloop.gms:13-16`

```
i20_processing_unitcosts("scp",kpr) = 0
```

**Why zero?**: Standard processing costs are zeroed out for SCP to avoid double-counting, since SCP costs are explicitly calculated using `f20_scp_unitcosts` in `q20_processing_costs` `equations.gms:120`.

**Rationale**: SCP hydrogen has no feedstock costs (no land requirement), so it needs separate accounting to avoid zero-cost production `preloop.gms:13-15`.

---

## Key Parameters

### Processing Conversion Factors `preloop.gms:9`

**Parameter**: `i20_processing_conversion_factors(t_all,processing20,ksd,kpr)`
**Unit**: Dimensionless (output/input ratio)
**Source**: `f20_processing_conversion_factors.cs3` `input.gms:15-18`

**Purpose**: Indicates how much secondary product `ksd` is obtained from one unit of primary product `kpr` via process `processing20`.

**Scope**: **Globally uniform** to avoid path dependencies `equations.gms:46-48`.

**Example values** (illustrative):
- Soybean → Oil: ~0.18 tDM oil per tDM soybean
- Soybean → Oilcake: ~0.77 tDM oilcake per tDM soybean
- Sugarcane → Sugar: ~0.13 tDM sugar per tDM sugarcane

### Processing Shares `preloop.gms:10`

**Parameter**: `i20_processing_shares(t_all,i,ksd,kpr)`
**Unit**: Fraction (0-1)
**Source**: `f20_processing_shares.cs3` `input.gms:20-23`

**Purpose**: Indicates what fraction of secondary product `ksd` in region `i` comes from primary product `kpr`.

**Scope**: **Region-specific** to capture historical processing patterns `equations.gms:51-52`.

**Constraint**: For each (i,ksd), sum over kpr should equal 1.0 (total shares).

**Example** (illustrative):
- In EU: oils from rapeseed = 0.4, from soybean = 0.3, from sunflower = 0.2, from palm = 0.1
- In SE Asia: oils from palm = 0.7, from soybean = 0.2, from other = 0.1

### Processing Unit Costs `preloop.gms:11`

**Parameter**: `i20_processing_unitcosts(ksd,kpr)`
**Unit**: USD17MER per tDM
**Source**: `f20_processing_unitcosts.cs3` `input.gms:25-28`

**Purpose**: Cost of transforming primary product `kpr` into secondary product `ksd`.

**Scope**: Route-specific (different costs for different primary products producing same secondary product).

**Data sources**: Literature (e.g., Adanacioglu et al. 2011, Pikaar et al. 2018, Valco et al. 2016) and expert estimates `equations.gms:107-108`.

**Special case**: SCP costs set to zero to avoid double-counting with `f20_scp_unitcosts` `preloop.gms:16`.

### Processing Balanceflow `equations.gms:62`

**Parameter**: `f20_processing_balanceflow(ct,i,ksd)`
**Unit**: mio. tDM
**Source**: `f20_processing_balanceflow.cs3` `input.gms:10-13`

**Purpose**: Static offset accounting for historical country-specific differences in processing efficiency while keeping conversion factors global `equations.gms:53-54`.

**Interpretation**: Historical balanceflow capturing deviations from global average conversion efficiency.

### Quality Cost `input.gms:30-33`

**Parameter**: `f20_quality_cost(ksd,kpr)`
**Unit**: USD17MER per tDM
**Source**: `f20_quality_cost.cs3` (realization-specific) `input.gms:30-33`

**Purpose**: Adjusts costs for quality differences among oils traded as homogeneous commodities `equations.gms:127-132`.

**Standardization**: Based on soybean oil price as reference `equations.gms:132`.

**Effect**:
- Low-quality oils (palm oil): positive cost adjustment (more expensive)
- High-quality oils: negative cost adjustment (cheaper)

## Variable Bounds `presolve.gms:9-19`

### Fixed to Zero

```
vm_dem_processing.fx(i,knpr) = 0
```

Non-processable products cannot be processed `presolve.gms:9`.

### Secondary Overproduction `presolve.gms:11-12`

```
vm_secondary_overproduction.fx(i2,kall,kpr) = 0
vm_secondary_overproduction.up(i2,ksd,kpr) = Inf
```

Only secondary products (ksd) can be overproduced; all others fixed to zero.

### Secondary Substitutes `presolve.gms:14-19`

```
v20_secondary_substitutes.fx(i2,ksd,kpr) = 0  [default]
v20_secondary_substitutes.up(i2,"oils",kpr) = Inf
v20_secondary_substitutes.up(i2,"molasses",kpr) = Inf
v20_secondary_substitutes.up(i2,"distillers_grain",kpr) = Inf
v20_secondary_substitutes.up(i2,"oilcakes",kpr) = Inf
v20_secondary_substitutes.up(i2,"brans",kcereals20) = Inf
```

**Default**: All substitution fixed to zero.

**Enabled substitutions**:
- Oils can be substituted by any primary product
- Molasses can be substituted by any primary product
- Distillers grain can be substituted by any primary product
- Oilcakes can be substituted by any primary product
- Brans can be substituted only by cereals (kcereals20)

---

## Realization Differences

### substitution_may21 vs. substitution_dec18

**Key change**: Removal of calibration factors `realization.gms:9`.

**Rationale**: The `substitution_dec18` realization included calibration factors that artificially constrained oil substitution. These were removed in `substitution_may21` to allow more flexible substitution based on economic optimization.

**Impact**: More responsive substitution of oils by other oils when relative prices or availability change.

## Limitations

### 1. Global Conversion Factors

**What it means**: All regions have the same conversion efficiency for primary → secondary products `equations.gms:46-48`.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Regional differences in processing technology
- Technology improvement over time within a region
- Economies of scale in processing facilities

**Justification**: Avoids path dependencies where future projections are locked into historical patterns `equations.gms:46-48`. Regional differences captured via `f20_processing_balanceflow`.

### 2. Static Balanceflow

**What it means**: `f20_processing_balanceflow` is a fixed historical offset `input.gms:10-13`.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Dynamic evolution of regional processing efficiency
- Convergence to global best practices
- Investment in processing infrastructure

### 3. Homogeneous Product Assumptions

**What it means**: Secondary products are treated as homogeneous within categories (all "oils" are equivalent) `equations.gms:127-129`.

**Partial correction**: Quality cost adjustments for oils `f20_quality_cost` provide some differentiation `equations.gms:130-132`.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Consumer preferences for specific oil types beyond price
- Nutritional differences beyond N/P/K content
- Quality differences for non-oil products

### 4. No Processing Capacity Constraints

**What it means**: Processing can scale instantly to any level without capacity limits.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Processing plant capacity constraints
- Capital investment requirements
- Construction time lags
- Stranded assets in declining industries

### 5. Fixed Coupled Product Ratios

**What it means**: Coupled products (oil + oilcake, sugar + molasses) are produced in fixed ratios determined by `i20_processing_conversion_factors`.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Process optimization to increase yield of valuable product
- Technology innovation to alter product ratios
- Differential extraction efficiency

**Mitigation**: Overproduction variable `vm_secondary_overproduction` allows excess coupled products to be discarded `equations.gms:56-57`.

### 6. Substitution Penalty

**What it means**: 200 USD/tDM flat penalty for ANY substitution `equations.gms:125-126`.

**Limitations**:
- Penalty magnitude is uniform across all product types
- Does not account for varying consumer preferences
- Arbitrary parameter (not empirically calibrated to substitution elasticities)

**Impact**: Strongly discourages substitution unless price differences exceed 200 USD/tDM.

### 7. SCP Hydrogen Exception

**What it means**: SCP from hydrogen has no land/feedstock requirements `preloop.gms:13-15`.

**Implication**: This creates a pathway for unlimited protein production decoupled from land constraints if hydrogen is available.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Hydrogen production costs (beyond `f20_scp_unitcosts`)
- Hydrogen infrastructure requirements
- Energy/electricity constraints
- Consumer acceptance of SCP

### 8. No Spatial Detail

**What it means**: Processing occurs at regional level (i), not cell level.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Transport costs from production cells to processing facilities
- Locational advantages (coastal processing for exports)
- Regional processing clusters
- Cross-border processing trade

### 9. No Processing Waste

**What it means**: All inputs are accounted for as outputs (primary → secondary + overproduction).

**What it does NOT model**:
- Processing losses (spillage, spoilage, combustion)
- Wastewater generation
- Energy use in processing
- Emissions from processing facilities

**Note**: Emissions from processing may be tracked elsewhere in the model, but not in this module.

### 10. No Dynamic Learning

**What it means**: Processing costs (`i20_processing_unitcosts`) are static parameters `input.gms:25-28`.

**What it does NOT model**:
- Learning-by-doing cost reductions
- Scale economies
- Technological innovation in processing
- R&D investments

## Example Flow: Soybean to Oil and Oilcake

**Illustrative example with hypothetical numbers:**

**Step 1**: Regional soybean production
- `vm_prod_reg(i2,"soybean")` = 100 mio. tDM

**Step 2**: Processing demand
- `v20_dem_processing(i2,"extracting","soybean")` = 95 mio. tDM
  - (5 mio. tDM used for seed, feed, food directly)

**Step 3**: Conversion to oil
```
q20_processing(i2,"soybean","oils"):
  95 * 0.18 = vm_prod_reg(i2,"oils") * processing_shares(i2,"oils","soybean") - substitutes + overprod
  17.1 mio. tDM oil from soybean
```
*Note: 0.18 is illustrative conversion factor*

**Step 4**: Conversion to oilcake
```
q20_processing(i2,"soybean","oilcakes"):
  95 * 0.77 = vm_prod_reg(i2,"oilcakes") * processing_shares(i2,"oilcakes","soybean") - substitutes + overprod
  73.15 mio. tDM oilcake from soybean
```
*Note: 0.77 is illustrative conversion factor*

**Step 5**: Balanceflow adjustment
- If historical data shows region i2 is less efficient, `f20_processing_balanceflow(ct,i2,"oils")` reduces the right-hand side requirement.

**Step 6**: Substitution (if needed)
- If palm oil is scarce, `v20_secondary_substitutes(i2,"oils","oilpalm")` > 0
- Soybean oil (or sunflower, rapeseed) substitutes for palm oil
- `q20_processing_substitution_oils` ensures sufficient substitution capacity

**Step 7**: Cost calculation
```
vm_cost_processing(i2) += 95 * 0.18 * unitcost("oils","soybean")
                         + 95 * 0.77 * unitcost("oilcakes","soybean")
```

**Step 8**: Substitution penalty (if substitution occurred)
```
vm_processing_substitution_cost(i2) += substitutes * 200
```

*All numerical values are illustrative for pedagogical purposes. Actual values are in input files `f20_processing_conversion_factors.cs3`, `f20_processing_shares.cs3`, `f20_processing_unitcosts.cs3`.*

## Participates In

### Conservation Laws
**Module 20 participates in Food Balance**:
- Calculates processing demand (primary → secondary products)
- Secondary products (oils, sugar, alcohol, ethanol, distillers grains, brans, SCP, molasses) enter food/feed system
- Mass balance: Primary inputs = Secondary outputs (accounting for conversion losses)

### Dependency Chains
**Centrality**: Low-medium (specialized conversion module)
- **Depends on**: Module 16 (demand for processed products)
- **Provides to**: Modules 11 (processing costs), 16 (secondary product supply)
- **Role**: **Product converter** - transforms primary agricultural products into processed forms

**Key equations**: 10 conversion equations (kall → kpr transformations)

### Circular Dependencies
**Zero circular dependencies** - processing is one-way transformation (primary → secondary).

**Note**: SCP (single-cell protein) has special circular structure within module (hydrogen → SCP, but self-contained).

### Modification Safety
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW-MEDIUM RISK** (specialized module, well-defined conversions)

**Safe Modifications**:
- ✅ Adjust conversion factors (efficiency of primary → secondary)
- ✅ Change processing costs
- ✅ Add new processed products (requires new conversion equations)

**Testing**:
1. **Mass balance**: Secondary output < primary input (conversion losses)
2. **Positive outputs**: All v20_dem_processing ≥ 0
3. **Cost plausibility**: Processing costs reasonable vs. raw material costs
