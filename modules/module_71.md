# Module 71: Livestock Disaggregation (foragebased_jul23)

**Realization**: `foragebased_jul23`
**File**: `modules/71_disagg_lvst/foragebased_jul23/`
**Authors**: Kristine Karstens, Benjamin Bodirsky

---

## Purpose

Module 71 distributes regional livestock production onto simulation cells (0.5° grid), accounting for spatial constraints on livestock systems. Without this module, cellular livestock distribution would be determined solely by transport costs (Module 40) and water availability (Module 42), leading to unrealistic spatial concentration.

**Code behavior**: The module implements two distinct distribution mechanisms:
1. **Ruminants** (beef, dairy): Constrained by local forage feed availability (pasture + fodder)
2. **Monogastrics** (pigs, chickens, eggs): Distributed based on urban area (population proxy)

This reflects the biological reality that ruminants depend on bulky, non-transportable forage, while monogastrics are intensive systems located near population centers.

## Core Concept

**Spatial Disaggregation**: Regional livestock production totals (optimized at regional level) are distributed to grid cells based on biophysical and economic constraints, not by optimizing cell-level production directly.

**Why disaggregation matters**:
- **Water demand**: Cellular livestock production drives water withdrawals (Module 42)
- **Transport costs**: Cell location determines transport costs to urban centers (Module 40)
- **Land use**: Pasture area responds to local ruminant distribution (Module 31)
- **Environmental impacts**: Manure and GHG emissions occur at cellular level

## Key Equations (6 total)

### 1. Ruminant Forage Production Constraint (`q71_feed_rum_liv`)

**Purpose**: Ensures local forage production meets (or exceeds) local ruminant feed requirements.

**Formula**:
```
vm_prod(j2,kforage) ≥ v71_feed_forage(j2,kforage) + v71_feed_balanceflow(j2,kforage)
```

**Components**:
- `vm_prod(j,kforage)`: Production of forage feed (pasture or fodder) in cell j (mio. tDM/yr)
- `v71_feed_forage(j,kforage)`: Required forage for ruminant production in cell j (mio. tDM/yr)
- `v71_feed_balanceflow(j,kforage)`: Adjustment for FAO data inconsistencies (mio. tDM/yr, can be positive or negative)

**Behavior**:
- Inequality constraint (≥): Cells can produce excess forage
- Separate constraints for pasture and fodder (two feed types)
- Balance flow accounts for same FAO inconsistencies as Module 70

**Interpretation**: Ruminant livestock cannot locate in cells without sufficient grazing land or fodder production capacity.

`equations.gms:14-17`

---

### 2. Forage Feed Requirements (`q71_feed_forage`)

**Purpose**: Calculates cellular ruminant feed requirements based on production and feed baskets.

**Formula**:
```
Σ(kforage) v71_feed_forage(j2,kforage) =
    Σ(kli_rum,kforage) [vm_prod(j2,kli_rum) × im_feed_baskets(ct,i2,kli_rum,kforage)]
```

**Components**:
- `vm_prod(j,kli_rum)`: Ruminant livestock production in cell j (livst_rum = beef, livst_milk = dairy) (mio. tDM/yr)
- `im_feed_baskets(t,i,kli_rum,kforage)`: Regional feed composition (tDM forage per tDM livestock product)
- `kforage`: Forage types (pasture, foddr)

**Behavior**:
- Sum over both forage types equals total forage requirement
- Feed baskets are regional parameters (from Module 70), not cell-specific
- Intensive systems (high productivity) require more fodder, extensive systems more pasture

**Example calculation** (illustrative numbers):
```
Cell produces 1,000 tDM beef
Feed basket: 2.5 tDM pasture + 0.5 tDM fodder per tDM beef
Required forage: 2,500 tDM pasture + 500 tDM fodder
```

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual feed baskets come from Module 70 data.*

`equations.gms:21-24`

---

### 3. Forage Balance Flow - Nonlinear Version (`q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp`)

**Purpose**: Distributes regional balance flow to cells proportionally to ruminant production share (default mode).

**Formula**:
```
Σ(kforage) v71_feed_balanceflow(j2,kforage) =
    Σ(ct,cell(i2,j2),kli_rum,kforage) [vm_feed_balanceflow(i2,kli_rum,kforage) × (vm_prod(j2,kli_rum) / vm_prod_reg(i2,kli_rum))]
```

**Components**:
- `vm_feed_balanceflow(i,kli_rum,kforage)`: Regional balance flow from Module 70 (mio. tDM/yr)
- `vm_prod(j,kli_rum) / vm_prod_reg(i,kli_rum)`: Cell's share of regional ruminant production (fraction)

**Behavior**:
- **Active when** `s71_lp_fix = 0` (default)
- Nonlinear due to division: `vm_prod(j,kli_rum) / vm_prod_reg(i,kli_rum)`
- Ensures balance flow is distributed consistently with production location
- Prevents numerical issues: `vm_prod_reg.lo(i,kli_rum) = 10^-6` (preloop.gms:17)

**Why nonlinear matters**: This constraint couples cell-level and regional-level production variables, requiring NLP solver (CONOPT).

`equations.gms:34-37`

---

### 4. Forage Balance Flow - Linear Version (`q71_feed_balanceflow_lp`)

**Purpose**: Alternative linear formulation for LP warmstart optimization (Module 80 lp_nlp_apr17).

**Formula**:
```
Σ(cell(i2,j2),kforage) v71_feed_balanceflow(j2,kforage) =
    Σ(ct,kli_rum,kforage) vm_feed_balanceflow(i2,kli_rum,kforage)
```

**Components**: Same as `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp` but without division.

**Behavior**:
- **Active when** `s71_lp_fix = 1` (set by Module 80 during LP phase)
- Replaces `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp` (never both active simultaneously)
- Balance flow can distribute freely among cells (no proportionality constraint)
- Enables linear programming solvers (CPLEX)

**Trade-off**: LP version is faster but less realistic (allows arbitrary spatial redistribution of balance flow).

`equations.gms:44-46`

---

### 5. Monogastric Production Distribution (`q71_prod_mon_liv`)

**Purpose**: Distributes monogastric livestock (pigs, chickens, eggs) to cells based on urban area.

**Formula**:
```
vm_prod(j2,kli_mon) ≤ i71_urban_area_share(j2) × s71_scale_mon × vm_prod_reg(i2,kli_mon) + v71_additional_mon(j2,kli_mon)
```

**Components**:
- `vm_prod(j,kli_mon)`: Monogastric production in cell j (mio. tDM/yr)
- `i71_urban_area_share(j)`: Cell's share of regional urban area (fraction, calculated in preloop.gms:8-10)
- `s71_scale_mon`: Flexibility scalar (default: 1.10 = 110%, allows 10% overcapacity)
- `vm_prod_reg(i,kli_mon)`: Regional monogastric production from Module 70 (mio. tDM/yr)
- `v71_additional_mon(j,kli_mon)`: Slack variable for excess production beyond urban constraint (mio. tDM/yr)

**Behavior**:
- Upper bound constraint (≤): Limits monogastric production to cells with urban area
- Urban area proxy for population density (intensive livestock near demand centers)
- 10% relaxation (`s71_scale_mon = 1.10`) accommodates peri-urban production
- Slack variable prevents infeasibility but incurs high penalty costs

**Rationale**: Monogastric systems are intensive operations located near population centers for:
- Feed logistics (concentrate feeds are transportable, sourced globally)
- Waste management (manure processing infrastructure)
- Market access (fresh meat/eggs to urban consumers)

`equations.gms:55-59`

---

### 6. Monogastric Transport Punishment (`q71_punishment_mon`)

**Purpose**: Penalizes monogastric production beyond urban area limits.

**Formula**:
```
vm_costs_additional_mon(i2) = Σ(cell(i2,j2),kli_mon) v71_additional_mon(j2,kli_mon) × s71_punish_additional_mon
```

**Components**:
- `vm_costs_additional_mon(i)`: Penalty costs passed to Module 11 (Costs) (mio. USD17MER/yr)
- `s71_punish_additional_mon`: Penalty factor (default: 15,000 USD17MER per tDM)

**Behavior**:
- Only incurs costs when `v71_additional_mon > 0`
- High penalty (15,000 USD17/tDM) makes violations rare
- Penalty represents extra transport costs between clusters
- Aggregated to regional level for cost module

**Calibration**: Penalty is "one order of magnitude of the average transport costs to account for additional transport between clusters" (equations.gms:71-72)

`equations.gms:66-69`

## Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description | Source |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `s71_lp_fix` | 0 | Switch for linear/nonlinear mode (0=NLP, 1=LP) | `preloop.gms:12` |
| `s71_scale_mon` | 1.10 | Flexibility scalar for monogastric distribution (10% overcapacity) | `preloop.gms:13` |
| `s71_punish_additional_mon` | 15,000 | Penalty for excess monogastric production (USD17MER per tDM) | `preloop.gms:14` |

**Usage notes**:
- `s71_lp_fix` is controlled by Module 80 (Optimization) during LP warmstart phase
- `s71_scale_mon = 1.10` means cells can host 110% of their "fair share" based on urban area
- Penalty costs are high to maintain spatial realism (violations indicate data issues or extreme scenarios)

---

## Sets and Dimensions

### Livestock Types

**Ruminants** (`kli_rum`):
- `livst_rum`: Beef cattle
- `livst_milk`: Dairy cattle

**Monogastrics** (`kli_mon`):
- `livst_pig`: Pigs
- `livst_chick`: Broiler chickens (meat)
- `livst_egg`: Layer chickens (eggs)

`sets.gms:9-17`

### Forage Feed Types

**`kforage`**:

- Fodder requires cropland (Module 30)
- Feed baskets vary by production system intensity (Module 70)

`sets.gms:19-23`

## Data Flow

### Interface Variables (Received)

| Variable | Provider Module | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| `vm_prod(j,kli)` | Optimized in 71 | Cellular livestock production (mio. tDM/yr) |
| `vm_prod_reg(i,kli)` | Optimized (regional aggregate) | Regional livestock production total (mio. tDM/yr) |
| `vm_feed_balanceflow(i,kli_rum,kforage)` | 70 (Livestock) | Regional balance flow for FAO consistency (mio. tDM/yr) |
| `im_feed_baskets(t,i,kli,kall)` | 70 (Livestock) | Feed composition by livestock type (tDM feed per tDM product) |
| `pm_land_start(j,land)` | 10 (Land) | Initial land use for urban area calculation (mio. ha) |
| `pcm_land(j,land)` | 10 (Land) | Current land use (mio. ha) |
| `fm_feed_balanceflow(t,i,kli_rum,kforage)` | 70 (Livestock, fixed data) | Historical balance flow for nl_fix bounds (mio. tDM/yr) |

### Interface Variables (Provided)

| Variable | Used by Module | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `vm_costs_additional_mon(i)` | 11 (Costs) | Penalty costs for monogastric transport (mio. USD17MER/yr) |

**Note**: `vm_prod(j,kli)` is both received and provided—Module 71 constrains cellular production to be consistent with regional totals but doesn't calculate production values directly. The optimization determines both levels simultaneously.

## Preloop Calculations

### Urban Area Share (`preloop.gms:8-10`)

**Formula**:
```
i71_urban_area_share(j) = pm_land_start(j,"urban") / Σ(cell(i,j3)) pm_land_start(j3,"urban")
```

**Purpose**: Calculate each cell's share of regional urban area (proxy for population density).

**Behavior**:
- Uses initial urban land from land initialization
- Normalizes to regional total (shares sum to 1 per region)
- Static throughout simulation (based on `pm_land_start`, not dynamic `vm_land`)

**Limitation**: Urban area does not update as urbanization proceeds (uses initial snapshot).

### Minimal Regional Production Bound (`preloop.gms:17`)

**Formula**:
```
vm_prod_reg.lo(i,kli_rum) = 10^-6    if s71_lp_fix = 0
```

**Purpose**: Prevent division by zero in `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp`.

**Behavior**:
- Only active in NLP mode (when division occurs)
- Extremely small lower bound (10^-6 tDM/yr ≈ 1 kg/yr)
- Negligible impact on results but critical for numerical stability

---

## nl_fix and nl_release

### nl_fix Phase (`nl_fix.gms:10-14`)

**Purpose**: Fix bounds on `v71_feed_balanceflow` during LP warmstart (Module 80 lp_nlp_apr17).

**Operations**:
```
v71_feed_balanceflow.lo(j,kforage) = 0     if regional balance flow > 0
v71_feed_balanceflow.up(j,kforage) = 0     if regional balance flow < 0
v71_feed_balanceflow.fx(j,kforage) = 0     if regional balance flow = 0
v71_feed_balanceflow.fx(j,"pasture") = 0   if no pastureland in cell
v71_feed_balanceflow.fx(j,"foddr") = 0     if no cropland in cell
```

**Logic**: Constrain cellular balance flow signs to match regional signs, and fix to zero where land type is absent.

**Why this matters**: Linearizes the problem by removing division in `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp` (replaced by `q71_feed_balanceflow_lp` when `s71_lp_fix=1`).

### nl_release Phase (`nl_release.gms:10-11`)

**Purpose**: Restore full flexibility for NLP solve.

**Operations**:
```
v71_feed_balanceflow.lo(j,kforage) = -Inf
v71_feed_balanceflow.up(j,kforage) = Inf
```

**Effect**: Remove bounds imposed during LP phase, allowing CONOPT to find optimal solution.

## Model Integration

### Cost Integration

**Module 71 → Module 11 (Costs)**:
```
vm_costs_additional_mon(i)    # Monogastric transport penalty
```

Module 11 aggregates into total regional costs:
```
vm_cost_glo = ... + Σ(i2) vm_costs_additional_mon(i2) + ...
```

**Typical behavior**: In well-calibrated scenarios, `vm_costs_additional_mon ≈ 0` (penalty rarely triggered).

### Production Disaggregation Chain

**Regional production (Module 70) → Cellular constraints (Module 71) → Land use impacts (Modules 31, 30)**:

1. Module 70 determines regional livestock production totals
2. Module 71 constrains spatial distribution based on forage/urban area
3. Module 31 (Pasture) calculates pastureland required for ruminant grazing
4. Module 30 (Croparea) accounts for fodder crop area
5. Module 42 (Water Demand) calculates cellular water needs for livestock

**Critical coupling**: Cellular livestock distribution affects:
- Water withdrawals (livestock drinking + irrigation for fodder)
- Transport costs (distance to urban markets)
- Manure N/P/K recycling (Module 55)
- GHG emissions (Modules 51, 53)

---

## Key Limitations

### 1. **Monogastrics Not Constrained by Feed Availability**

**What the code does**: Distributes monogastrics by urban area share only.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT check if cells have sufficient feed sources for monogastrics
- Does NOT account for corn/soybean availability in cell
- Does NOT limit concentration density (e.g., pigs per hectare)

**Justification**: Monogastric feed (concentrates) is highly transportable, sourced globally via trade (Module 21).

`realization.gms:18`

### 2. **Crop Residue Feed Not Considered**

**What the code does**: Only constrains ruminants by pasture and fodder.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT use crop residues (straw, stover) to support ruminant production
- Does NOT account for residue availability from nearby cropland

**Implication**: May underestimate ruminant production capacity in mixed crop-livestock systems.

`realization.gms:19-20`

### 3. **Forage Treated as Non-Transportable**

**What the code does**: Assumes forage (pasture + fodder) cannot move between cells.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT allow forage trade within regions
- Does NOT model hay/silage transport (short distances in reality)

**Justification**: Forage is bulky and perishable; long-distance transport is uneconomical. But some local transport occurs in reality.

`realization.gms:20`

### 4. **Static Urban Area**

**What the code does**: Uses initial urban area (`pm_land_start`) to calculate shares in preloop.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT update urban area as urbanization proceeds (Module 34)
- Does NOT respond to population growth or migration

**Implication**: Monogastric distribution becomes less realistic in long-term scenarios with significant urbanization.

`preloop.gms:8-10`

### 5. **Regional Feed Baskets Applied Uniformly**

**What the code does**: Uses regional average feed baskets (`im_feed_baskets(i,kli_rum,kforage)`).

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT account for cell-specific feed quality or composition
- Does NOT model heterogeneous production systems within regions
- Does NOT differentiate between rangeland grazing and intensive feedlots at cell level

**Implication**: All cells in a region are assumed to have same feed conversion efficiency.

### 6. **No Spatial Optimization of Ruminant Location**

**What the code does**: Constraints cellular production based on forage availability, but cells compete for regional production total via transport costs (Module 40) and other factors.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT explicitly optimize ruminant location to minimize environmental impacts
- Does NOT prefer cells with low water stress or high biodiversity for livestock

**Note**: Spatial distribution emerges from cost minimization (transport, water, land conversion), not direct optimization.

### 7. **Penalty Cost Calibration Assumption**

**What the code does**: Sets `s71_punish_additional_mon = 15,000 USD17/tDM` based on "one order of magnitude of average transport costs."

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT calibrate penalty dynamically to regional transport costs
- Does NOT use empirical data on long-distance livestock transport costs
- Does NOT account for differing transport infrastructure quality

**Sensitivity**: Results sensitive to penalty value; too low → unrealistic concentration, too high → infeasibility.

`preloop.gms:14`, `equations.gms:71-72`

### 8. **No Intracellular Heterogeneity**

**What the code does**: Treats each 0.5° grid cell as homogeneous.

**What the code does NOT do**:
- Does NOT model variation in pasture quality within cells
- Does NOT account for topography (flat vs. mountainous)
- Does NOT distinguish rangeland quality (desert vs. grassland)

**Implication**: May overestimate ruminant capacity in cells with heterogeneous landscapes.

---

## Typical Model Runs

### Scenario 1: Standard Run (NLP Mode)

**Configuration**:
```
s71_lp_fix = 0
s71_scale_mon = 1.10
s71_punish_additional_mon = 15,000
```

**Behavior**:
- Ruminants distributed by forage availability (hard constraint via `q71_feed_rum_liv`)
- Balance flow distributed proportionally to production (`q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp`)
- Monogastrics distributed by urban area with 10% flexibility
- NLP solver (CONOPT) required due to division in balance flow equation

**Use case**: Default mode for full accuracy

### Scenario 2: LP Warmstart (Module 80 lp_nlp_apr17)

**Configuration** (set by Module 80):
```
s71_lp_fix = 1    # During LP phase
s71_lp_fix = 0    # After nl_release
```

**Behavior**:
- **LP phase**: Uses `q71_feed_balanceflow_lp` (linear), CPLEX solver
- **NLP phase**: Switches to `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp` (nonlinear), CONOPT solver
- Balance flow bounds fixed during LP phase (`nl_fix.gms`)
- Bounds released for NLP phase (`nl_release.gms`)

**Advantage**: Faster convergence (LP provides good starting point for NLP)

**Use case**: Large-scale runs with many timesteps (Module 80 lp_nlp_apr17 realization)

### Scenario 3: Alternative Realization (off)

**Configuration**: Use `%disagg_lvst% = "off"` in config

**Behavior**:
- Module 71 inactive (no disaggregation)
- Cellular livestock production determined solely by transport costs (Module 40) and water (Module 42)
- Likely unrealistic spatial concentration (all production in lowest-cost cells)

**Use case**: Computational efficiency testing, baseline comparison

---

## Alternative Realization: foragebased_aug18

**Key differences from foragebased_jul23**:

1. **No nl_fix/nl_release support**: Cannot be used with Module 80 lp_nlp_apr17
2. **No minimal production bound**: May encounter division by zero errors
3. **Same core logic**: Forage-based ruminant and urban-based monogastric distribution

**When to use**:
- `foragebased_jul23`: Default, supports LP warmstart, numerically stable
- `foragebased_aug18`: Legacy realization, use only if reproducing old results

---

## Technical Notes

### 1. Division by Zero Protection

**Problem**: `q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp` contains division:
```
vm_prod(j2,kli_rum) / vm_prod_reg(i2,kli_rum)
```

**Solution**: Minimal lower bound on denominator:
```
vm_prod_reg.lo(i,kli_rum) = 10^-6
```

**Effect**: Even regions with near-zero ruminant production have tiny positive value, preventing division by zero.

`preloop.gms:17`

### 2. Balance Flow Sign Logic

**In Module 70**: Regional balance flow can be positive or negative:
- **Positive**: Actual feed use > calculated feed requirement (underestimated conversion efficiency)
- **Negative**: Actual feed use < calculated feed requirement (overestimated conversion efficiency)

**In Module 71**: Cellular balance flow inherits regional sign, distributed proportionally.

**nl_fix logic**: Bounds enforce sign consistency (positive balance flow → positive cellular balance flow).

`nl_fix.gms:10-12`

### 3. Nonlinearity Source

**Only nonlinear term in Module 71**:
```
vm_prod(j,kli_rum) / vm_prod_reg(i,kli_rum)    in q71_feed_balanceflow_nlp
```

**All other equations**: Linear or inequality constraints

**Implication**: If `s71_lp_fix=1`, entire module becomes linear (can use LP solvers).

### 4. Urban Area as Population Proxy

**Assumption**: Urban land area correlates with population density.

**Validity**:
- Strong correlation at regional scale
- Weaker at cell level (density varies widely)
- Historical snapshot (not dynamic)

**Alternative approaches considered**: Direct population data, but urban area is consistent with MAgPIE's land-use framework.
