# Module 11: Costs (default)

**Realization:** `default`
**Total Lines of Code:** 147
**Equation Count:** 2
**Status:** ✅ Fully Verified (2025-10-12)

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Module 11 is the **central cost aggregation hub** and **defines MAgPIE's optimization objective** (`module.gms:8-15`). It calculates total global production costs by summing regional costs, which in turn aggregate costs from 30+ different production activities across all other modules.

**Core Function:** `vm_cost_glo` = Σ(all regional costs) → This is the variable MAgPIE **minimizes** in its objective function.

**Architectural Role:** Module 11 is a **pure aggregator** with no independent logic or input data. It depends entirely on cost variables provided by other modules and serves as the single point where all economic components converge into the optimization objective.

### 1.2 Key Features

1. **Global Cost Aggregation** (`equations.gms:10`): Sums regional costs to produce global total
2. **Regional Cost Aggregation** (`equations.gms:15-45`): Sums 30+ cost components from production, land use, emissions, and policy modules
3. **Objective Function Definition:** `vm_cost_glo` is the variable MAgPIE minimizes
4. **Scaling for Numerical Stability** (`scaling.gms:8-10`): Applies scaling factors to improve solver performance
5. **Zero Configuration:** Module has no input files, switches, or parameters of its own

### 1.3 Critical Importance

**Module 11 is non-negotiable:**
- Without it, MAgPIE has no objective function (solver cannot run)
- It connects **all production decisions** to a single economic metric (USD/yr)
- Any cost missed here is **ignored by optimization** (model will use "free" resources)

**Dependency Impact:**
- **Upstream:** 30+ modules provide cost variables
- **Downstream:** Solver uses `vm_cost_glo` to guide all land-use and production decisions

## 2. Core Equations

Module 11 implements only 2 equations, both pure summations with no parameters or complex logic.

### 2.1 Equation q11_cost_glo: Global Cost Aggregation

**File:** `equations.gms:10`

```gams
q11_cost_glo .. vm_cost_glo =e= sum(i2, v11_cost_reg(i2));
```

**What This Equation Does:**

Sums regional costs across all regions to produce the global total cost.

**Mathematical Structure:**

```
GlobalCost = Σ(RegionalCost_i)  for all regions i
```

**Components:**

- **vm_cost_glo**: Global total cost (mio. USD17MER/yr) — **THIS IS THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION**
- **v11_cost_reg(i)**: Regional cost for region i (mio. USD17MER/yr)
- **i2**: Regions currently active in simulation (typically 10-14 MAgPIE regions)

**Currency Unit:** USD17MER = 2017 US Dollars at Market Exchange Rates (not Purchasing Power Parity)

**Conceptual Meaning:**

This equation defines what MAgPIE minimizes. Every decision about land use, production, trade, and technology is evaluated based on how it affects `vm_cost_glo`. Lower cost solutions are preferred by the solver.

**Citation:** `equations.gms:10-13`

                   + vm_water_cost(i2)
;
```

**What This Equation Does:**

Aggregates all cost components for a single region from 30+ different modules.

              + BiodiversityLossCosts
              + UrbanLandCosts
              + WaterCosts
```

**Note:** `vm_reward_cdr_aff` has a **negative sign** — afforestation CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) generates revenue, reducing net costs.

## 4. Interface Variables

### 4.1 Output (Provided to Solver)

**vm_cost_glo** - Global total production cost (mio. USD17MER/yr)
**Purpose:** **Objective function variable** — MAgPIE minimizes this
**Calculated by:** Equation q11_cost_glo (sum of regional costs)
**Used by:** GAMS solver to guide optimization
**Citation:** `declarations.gms:9`

**Critical:** This is the ONLY variable MAgPIE directly minimizes. All other optimization behavior (land allocation, production levels, trade flows) is a result of minimizing `vm_cost_glo` subject to constraints.

---

### 4.2 Intermediate Variable

**v11_cost_reg(i)** - Regional total production cost (mio. USD17MER/yr)
**Purpose:** Intermediate aggregation for cleaner code structure
**Calculated by:** Equation q11_cost_reg (sum of 30+ cost components)
**Used by:** Equation q11_cost_glo (aggregated to global total)
**Citation:** `declarations.gms:10`

---

### 4.3 Inputs (Received from Other Modules)

Module 11 receives **30+ cost variables** from other modules. See Section 3 for complete mapping.

**Key Pattern:** All cost variables have naming convention `vm_cost_*` or `vm_*_cost*` and units of mio. USD17MER/yr.

**Exception:** `vm_reward_cdr_aff` is revenue, not cost, hence the negative sign in the equation.

---

## 5. Scaling for Numerical Stability

**File:** `scaling.gms:8-10`

```gams
vm_cost_glo.scale = 10e7;
v11_cost_reg.scale(i) = 10e6;
vm_cost_transp.scale(j,k) = 10e3;
```

**What This Does:**

Informs GAMS solver about typical magnitude of variables to improve numerical conditioning.

**Scaling Values:**

- **vm_cost_glo:** ~10^8 USD/yr (hundreds of billions of dollars globally)
- **v11_cost_reg:** ~10^7 USD/yr (tens of billions per region)
- **vm_cost_transp:** ~10^4 USD/yr (tens of thousands per cell-commodity)

**Why Scaling Matters:**

GAMS solvers perform better when variables are O(1-1000) rather than O(10^6-10^9). Scaling transforms internal representation without changing actual values.

**Citation:** `scaling.gms:8-10`

## 6. Configuration and Customization

### 6.1 No Configuration Files

Module 11 has **no input files** (`input.gms` does not exist).

### 6.2 No Configuration Switches

Module 11 has **no scalars or parameters** to configure (`input.gms` does not exist).

### 6.3 Realization Options

Only **one realization exists:** `default`

**Rationale:** Cost aggregation is fundamental and universal. There's no alternative way to structure it.

---

## 7. Dependencies and Impact

### 7.1 Critical Upstream Dependencies

**Module 11 depends on 30+ modules** providing cost variables:

**Core Production Modules:**
- Module 38 (Factor Costs): Production costs for crops, livestock, pasture
- Module 30 (Crop): Cropland and rotation costs
- Module 31 (Pasture): Pasture management costs

**Land Use Modules:**
- Module 39 (Land Conversion): Conversion costs
- Module 10 (Land): Land transition and urban costs

**Input Modules:**
- Module 50 (Nitrogen): Fertilizer costs
- Module 41 (Irrigation): Irrigation expansion costs

**Environmental Modules:**
- Module 56 (GHG Policy): Emission costs and CDR rewards
- Module 57 (MACCS): Abatement costs
- Module 59 (SOM): Soil carbon management costs
- Module 58 (Peatland): Peatland restoration costs

**Economic Modules:**
- Module 21 (Trade): Trade costs
- Module 40 (Transport): Transportation costs
- Module 20 (Processing): Processing costs

**Forestry Modules:**
- Module 32 (Forestry): Afforestation and plantation costs
- Module 35 (Natural Vegetation): Natural harvest costs

**If ANY of these modules fails to define its cost variable, Module 11 will fail.**

### 7.2 Critical Downstream Dependencies

**GAMS Solver:**
- Solver uses `vm_cost_glo` as objective function
- Without Module 11, **MAgPIE cannot run** (no objective)

**All Modules (Indirect):**
- Every module's decisions are evaluated based on how they affect `vm_cost_glo`
- If a cost is missing from Module 11, that activity becomes "free" and will be over-used by the model

### 7.3 Circular Dependencies

**None.** Module 11 is a pure aggregator at the end of the dependency chain.

---

## 8. What This Module Does NOT Do

Following the "Code Truth" principle:

### 8.1 No Cost Calculation

- **Does NOT calculate** any costs itself
- **DOES aggregate** costs calculated by other modules
- All cost logic resides in source modules, not Module 11

### 8.2 No Dynamic Pricing or Markets

- **Does NOT model** supply-demand price equilibrium
- **Does NOT adjust** costs based on scarcity or abundance
- All costs are exogenous or calculated by source modules before reaching Module 11

### 8.3 No Cost-Benefit Analysis

- **Does NOT compare** costs to benefits (e.g., welfare, nutrition, ecosystem services)
- **DOES minimize** costs subject to production constraints
- Benefits/demand are represented as constraints (in Module 15, 70, etc.), not in objective function

### 8.4 No Discounting or Intertemporal Optimization

- **Does NOT apply** discount rates to future costs
- **DOES minimize** each time step independently (recursive dynamic, not forward-looking)
- Discounting, if any, is handled in post-processing or in source modules

### 8.5 No Cost Allocation or Attribution

- **Does NOT calculate** cost per unit of output (e.g., $/ton of wheat)
- **DOES sum** total costs across all activities
- Cost attribution is post-processing, not part of optimization

---

## 9. Critical Code Patterns

### 9.1 Sum Over Cells for Cell-Level Costs

**Pattern:** Many costs are defined at cell level (j) but aggregated to regional level (i):

```gams
+ sum((cell(i2,j2),land), vm_cost_landcon(j2,land))
+ sum((cell(i2,j2),k), vm_cost_transp(j2,k))
+ sum(cell(i2,j2), vm_cost_scm(j2))
```

**Why:** Optimization occurs at cell level for spatial decisions, but costs are aggregated to regional and global levels for the objective function.

**Mapping:** `cell(i,j)` set defines which cells belong to which region.

### 9.2 Sum Over Dimensions for Multi-Dimensional Costs

**Pattern:** Some costs have additional dimensions (factors, crops, etc.):

```gams
+ sum(factors,vm_cost_prod_crop(i2,factors))
+ sum(kres,vm_cost_prod_kres(i2,kres))
+ sum(factors,vm_maccs_costs(i2,factors))
```

**Why:** These costs vary by factor type or commodity, but objective function needs total cost across all types.

### 9.3 Single Negative Term for CDR Rewards

**Pattern:** Only one cost component has a negative sign:

```gams
- vm_reward_cdr_aff(i2)
```

**Why:** Afforestation carbon dioxide removal generates revenue under carbon pricing policies. Revenue is negative cost.

**Implication:** If CDR rewards exceed all other costs (unlikely but possible in edge cases), `vm_cost_glo` could become negative. Solver would then maximize afforestation until constrained by land availability or other limits.

### 9.4 No Conditional Logic

**Pattern:** All terms are always included (no `if` statements or conditional sums).

**Why:** Module 11 has no switches or scenarios. If a cost variable is zero (e.g., `vm_emission_costs = 0` when no carbon price), it contributes zero to the sum but doesn't require special handling.

**Implication:** Source modules are responsible for setting their cost variables to zero when inactive. Module 11 blindly sums everything.

## 10. Testing and Validation Procedures

### 10.1 Equation Count Verification

```bash
grep "^[ ]*q11_" modules/11_costs/default/declarations.gms | wc -l
# Expected: 2
```

**Verified:** ✅ 2 equations (q11_cost_glo, q11_cost_reg)

### 10.2 Cost Component Coverage Check

**After running MAgPIE:**

1. **Check that all 30+ cost variables are non-negative** (except `vm_reward_cdr_aff`):
   ```gams
   * Inspect solution values for all cost variables listed in Section 3
   * Flag any negative costs (would indicate source module error)
   ```

2. **Check regional costs sum to global cost:**
   ```gams
   * Compare vm_cost_glo.l vs. sum(i, v11_cost_reg.l(i))
   * Should be equal within solver tolerance (< 0.01%)
   ```

3. **Identify dominant cost components:**
   ```gams
   * Rank all 30+ cost variables by magnitude
   * Top 5-10 components should account for >90% of total
   * Typical dominants: vm_cost_prod_crop, vm_emission_costs, vm_tech_cost
   ```

### 10.3 Objective Function Verification

**After model run:**

1. **Confirm objective function matches cost total:**
   ```gams
   * GAMS objective function value = vm_cost_glo.l
   * Should be reported in solve summary
   ```

2. **Check for negative total costs:**
   ```gams
   * vm_cost_glo.l should be positive in realistic scenarios
   * Negative total → CDR rewards exceed all costs (check if intended)
   ```

3. **Check time series trend:**
   ```gams
   * vm_cost_glo should generally increase over time (population growth, production increase)
   * Sharp drops or spikes → investigate which cost component changed
   ```

### 10.4 Scaling Effectiveness Check

**During solve:**

1. **Check solver messages for scaling warnings:**
   - "Matrix very ill-conditioned" → may need to adjust scaling factors
   - "Objective function scaled to 1e8" → current scaling is working

2. **Inspect internal solver statistics:**
   - Variable magnitudes should be O(1-1000) after scaling
   - If variables still O(10^6), update scaling.gms factors

## 11. Common Issues and Debugging

### 11.1 Missing Cost Variable Error

**Symptom:** GAMS compilation error "Undefined variable: vm_cost_XXX"

**Likely Cause:**
- Source module not included in run
- Source module doesn't define cost variable in its declarations.gms

**Solution:**
1. Check if source module is active in config/default.cfg
2. Verify source module's declarations.gms defines the variable
3. If module is intentionally excluded, comment out that cost term in q11_cost_reg

**Not a Module 11 issue** — missing variables indicate upstream module problems.

### 11.2 Negative Regional Costs (Unexpected)

**Symptom:** `v11_cost_reg.l(i)` is negative for some region.

**Likely Causes:**
1. `vm_reward_cdr_aff(i)` exceeds all other costs in that region (possible if massive afforestation)
2. Source module incorrectly defines revenue as cost (should be negative sign in Module 11)
3. Source module has bug producing negative cost values

**Solutions:**
1. **If CDR rewards:** Check if scenario intended (e.g., high carbon price + large afforestation potential)
2. **If source module error:** Fix source module to produce positive costs, or add negative sign in Module 11 if it's truly revenue
3. **Diagnostic:** Inspect all cost components for that region to identify negative term

### 11.3 Unrealistic Cost Magnitudes

**Symptom:** `vm_cost_glo` is orders of magnitude too high or too low (e.g., 10^3 or 10^12 when expecting 10^8).

**Likely Causes:**
1. **Currency unit mismatch:** Source module reports in wrong units (e.g., USD instead of mio. USD)
2. **Missing cost component:** Major cost (e.g., labor) is zero, so total is unrealistically low
3. **Duplicate cost:** Same cost included twice via different variables

**Solutions:**
1. **Check units:** All cost variables should be in mio. USD17MER/yr
2. **Check coverage:** Confirm all major cost types (labor, capital, land, inputs) are non-zero
3. **Check for double-counting:** Verify no cost is included in both a specific variable and a generic one

**Diagnostic:** Compare cost breakdown (Section 10.3.3) to expected shares from literature or historical runs.

### 11.4 Solver Fails with "Objective Function Infeasible"

**Symptom:** Solver terminates with infeasible solution and objective function value is undefined.

**Likely Cause:**
- Constraints are over-determined (no feasible solution exists)
- **Not a Module 11 issue** — constraints are defined in other modules

**Solutions:**
1. Relax constraints in source modules (e.g., allow demand to be unmet)
2. Check for conflicting constraints (e.g., land demand exceeds land availability)
3. Review solver log for which constraints are binding at infeasibility

**Module 11 only aggregates costs** — it doesn't create constraints that cause infeasibility.

### 11.5 Cost Components Don't Sum Correctly

**Symptom:** Manual sum of cost components ≠ `v11_cost_reg.l(i)`

**Likely Causes:**
1. **Aggregation error:** Forgot to sum over cells or dimensions
2. **Units mismatch:** Some costs in wrong units
3. **GAMS reporting error:** Reading solution values incorrectly

**Diagnosis:**
```gams
* In postsolve, calculate:
parameter p11_cost_check(i);
p11_cost_check(i) = sum(factors,vm_cost_prod_crop.l(i,factors))
                  + sum(kres,vm_cost_prod_kres.l(i,kres))
                  + ... [all terms from q11_cost_reg];

* Compare p11_cost_check(i) vs. v11_cost_reg.l(i)
* Should be equal within 1e-6
```

## 12. Key Insights for Users

### 12.1 Objective Function = Minimize Costs Only

MAgPIE is **NOT a cost-benefit analysis** or welfare maximization model. It minimizes costs subject to demand constraints.

**Implication:** Model will not "invest" in environmental benefits (e.g., biodiversity conservation) unless:
1. Constraint forces it (e.g., protected areas)
2. Policy makes it cost-effective (e.g., carbon price creates CDR rewards)
3. Cost penalty assigned to environmental loss (e.g., `vm_cost_bv_loss`)

**Not represented in objective:** Consumer surplus, ecosystem services, health benefits, social welfare.

### 12.2 Missing Costs = Free Resources

If a cost is not included in Module 11, the model treats that resource as free and will use it without limit.

**Example:** If water extraction costs (`vm_water_cost`) were excluded, model would use infinite water (limited only by physical availability constraints, not economics).

**Implication:** Module 11 coverage determines what the model "cares about" economically.

### 12.3 CDR Rewards Can Drive Afforestation

With high carbon prices, afforestation CDR can generate more revenue than it costs, making `vm_reward_cdr_aff` very large.

**Implication:** If CDR rewards are substantial, model may afforest aggressively even at expense of higher production costs elsewhere. This is economically rational but may not align with other policy goals.

**Scenario design:** Adjust carbon price or CDR eligibility rules (in Module 56) to control afforestation extent.

### 12.4 Regional Costs Don't Reflect Regional Welfare

Regional costs (`v11_cost_reg`) measure production costs in each region, but:
- Don't account for trade revenues/expenses (net importer vs. exporter)
- Don't reflect regional food security or nutrition
- Don't include consumer prices (only producer costs)

**Implication:** Low-cost regions may be net exporters but food-insecure (if domestic demand not met). Costs alone don't indicate welfare.

### 12.5 Recursive Dynamic = No Foresight

MAgPIE minimizes costs **one time step at a time**, without anticipating future costs.

**Implication:** Model may make decisions that are cheap today but expensive tomorrow (e.g., soil degradation, forest loss). This is intentional — represents myopic decision-making by current actors.

**Alternative:** Intertemporal optimization (not implemented) would minimize discounted future costs, allowing forward-looking investment decisions.

## 13. Relationship to Other Modules

### 13.1 Provides Objective Function To

- **GAMS Solver:** `vm_cost_glo` is minimized to find optimal solution

### 13.2 Receives Cost Variables From

**30+ modules** — see complete list in Section 3

**Key Providers:**
- Module 38 (Factor Costs): Largest contributor (labor, capital, land)
- Module 56 (GHG Policy): Emission costs and CDR rewards
- Module 21 (Trade): Trade costs
- Module 13 (Technological Change): Investment costs for intensification

### 13.3 No Circular Dependencies

Module 11 is at the **end of the dependency chain** — it aggregates costs but doesn't provide variables to other modules (except the solver).

---

## 14. Module Evolution and Future Extensions

### 14.1 Current Realization (default)

**Features:**
- Simple summation of 30+ cost components
- No dynamic weighting or prioritization
- No cost uncertainty or risk aversion

### 14.2 Potential Future Realizations (Not Implemented)

**1. Weighted Objective:**
- Apply regional weights to costs (e.g., prioritize low-income regions)
- Would require: `sum(i, weight(i) * v11_cost_reg(i))`
- Use case: Equity-focused scenarios

**2. Multi-Objective:**
- Minimize costs AND maximize other objectives (e.g., biodiversity, nutrition)
- Would require: Pareto frontier search or scalarization weights
- Use case: Trade-off analysis

**3. Risk-Averse Objective:**
- Minimize expected costs plus risk penalty (variance, Value-at-Risk)
- Would require: Stochastic programming or robust optimization
- Use case: Climate uncertainty, price volatility

**4. Discounted Intertemporal:**
- Minimize net present value of all future costs
- Would require: Forward-looking optimization, discount rate
- Use case: Long-term investment planning (e.g., climate mitigation)

**None of these alternatives currently exist.** Module 11 implements only simple cost summation.

## 15. Numerical Properties

### 15.1 Typical Magnitudes

**Global costs (`vm_cost_glo`):**
- Baseline scenarios: ~10^8 mio. USD/yr (100 billion USD/yr) in 1995
- Future scenarios: ~10^8 to 10^9 mio. USD/yr by 2050 (population and production growth)

**Regional costs (`v11_cost_reg`):**
- Developed regions: ~10^7 mio. USD/yr (tens of billions)
- Developing regions: ~10^6 to 10^7 mio. USD/yr

**Scaling factors (Section 5):** Chosen based on these typical magnitudes to keep internal solver representation O(1-1000).

### 15.2 Cost Composition (Typical Shares)

**Based on standard MAgPIE runs:**
- Factor costs (labor, capital): 40-60% of total
- Emission costs (with carbon price): 10-30%
- Input costs (fertilizer, irrigation): 10-20%
- Trade and transport: 5-10%
- Land conversion: 2-5%
- Other costs: 5-15%

**Highly scenario-dependent:** High carbon price → emission costs dominate; high agricultural intensification → input costs increase.

## 16. Summary

Module 11 is the **simplest yet most critical module in MAgPIE**:

**What It Does:**
- Aggregates costs from 30+ modules into regional totals (`q11_cost_reg`)
- Sums regional totals into global cost (`q11_cost_glo`)
- Defines the objective function MAgPIE minimizes

**What It Doesn't Do:**
- Calculate any costs (all logic in source modules)
- Apply weights, discounting, or risk penalties
- Model prices, markets, or equilibrium

**Critical Principle:** Every economic consideration in MAgPIE MUST flow through Module 11 to affect optimization. Missing costs = free resources = over-use.

**Key Dependencies:**
- **Upstream:** 30+ modules providing cost variables
- **Downstream:** GAMS solver minimizing `vm_cost_glo`
- **No circular dependencies**

**Testing Priority:**
1. Verify all cost variables are defined and non-negative
2. Confirm regional costs sum to global cost (within solver tolerance)
3. Check cost composition matches expected economic structure
4. Validate objective function value is realistic (10^8-10^9 mio. USD/yr)

**Common Use:**
- Usually no changes needed to Module 11 itself
- Add new cost types by:
  1. Defining new cost variable in source module
  2. Adding new term to `q11_cost_reg` equation
  3. Documenting in Section 3 of this file

**For modifications:** Module 11 changes affect **entire model behavior** — any change to objective function alters every optimization decision. Modifications should be extremely rare and carefully validated.
