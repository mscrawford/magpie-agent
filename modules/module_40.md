# Module 40: Transport - Technical Documentation

**Status**: Fully verified
**Realization**: gtap_nov12 (active), off (disabled)
**Equations**: 1 (gtap_nov12), 0 (off)
**Interface Variables**: 1 (vm_cost_transp)

## Executive Summary

Module 40 (Transport) calculates intraregional transportation costs for agricultural products between production sites and urban market centers. The module uses a simple multiplicative formula combining cell-level production, travel distance to cities, and commodity-specific transport costs calibrated to GTAP 7 data. Transportation costs add to the objective function via Module 11 (Costs), influencing optimal land allocation by penalizing production in remote areas.

**Core equation**: `vm_cost_transp(j,k) = vm_prod(j,k) × f40_distance(j) × f40_transport_costs(k)`

**Key insight**: The module treats transport infrastructure as static (travel times fixed from Nelson et al. 2008 data circa 2000), meaning MAgPIE does NOT model infrastructure improvements, new roads, or changes in accessibility over time.

#### q40_cost_transport: Transportation Cost Calculation

**Location**: `equations.gms:11-13`

```gams
q40_cost_transport(j2,k) ..
  vm_cost_transp(j2,k) =e= vm_prod(j2,k)*f40_distance(j2)
                           * f40_transport_costs(k);
```

**Interpretation**:
- Cell-level transport costs = Production × Distance × Commodity cost factor
- Linear relationship: doubling production or distance doubles transport costs
- Commodity-specific factors: crops with high value/weight (oils) have lower relative costs than bulk commodities (cereals)

**Dimensions**:
- `j2`: Spatial cluster cells (~200 cells globally)
- `k`: Commodity types (kall set, includes crops, livestock products, timber, etc.)

**Units**: Million USD17MER per year (2017 USD at market exchange rates)

**Variables**:
- `vm_cost_transp(j2,k)`: Transportation costs (output variable) - `declarations.gms:13`
- `vm_prod(j2,k)`: Cell-level production from Module 17 (read from upstream) - `equations.gms:12`

**Parameters**:
- `f40_distance(j2)`: Travel time from cell to nearest urban center (minutes) - `input.gms:15-21`
- `f40_transport_costs(k)`: Commodity-specific transport cost factor (USD17MER per tDM per minute) - `input.gms:23-28`

**Special case**:
- `s40_pasture_transport_costs = 0` → Pasture transport costs fixed to zero (grass not transported, consumed in situ by grazing animals) - `input.gms:10`

## Key Parameters and Data Sources

### f40_distance(j): Travel Time to Urban Centers

**Source**: Nelson et al. 2008, European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC JRC)
**Data**: 30 arc-second resolution global travel time map
**File**: `modules/40_transport/input/transport_distance.cs2`
**Citation**: `equations.gms:20-28`

**Methodology** (from Nelson et al. 2008):
1. Friction surface calculation based on:
   - Biophysical indicators (terrain slope, rivers, vegetation)
   - Administrative boundaries (national borders increase friction)
   - Transport infrastructure (roads, railways, waterways)
2. Least-cost path algorithm computes travel time to nearest city of 50,000+ inhabitants
3. Global coverage, circa 2000 baseline data

**Aggregation**: 30 arc-second data → MAgPIE cluster cells (~0.5°) via area-weighted averaging

**Units**: Minutes (travel time from cell centroid to nearest major city)

**Typical values** (illustrative examples, not actual data):
- Urban cell: 5-20 minutes
- Accessible rural: 30-120 minutes
- Remote interior: 300-1000+ minutes (5-16+ hours)
- Island/mountain: Can exceed 2000 minutes (>30 hours)

*Note: These are illustrative ranges for pedagogy. Actual cell-specific values require reading `transport_distance.cs2` file.*

### f40_transport_costs(k): Commodity Transport Cost Factors

**Source**: GTAP 7 database (Narayanan & Walmsley 2008)
**Calibration year**: 2004 GTAP data, scaled to 1995 for MAgPIE initialization
**File**: `modules/40_transport/gtap_nov12/input/f40_transport_costs.csv`
**Citation**: `equations.gms:35-68`

**GTAP 7 transport cost concept** (`equations.gms:36-44`):
- GTAP represents sector-to-sector transport costs (e.g., farm → mill, mill → retailer)
- MAgPIE needs market-to-market transport costs (production site → urban market)
- Assumption: Agricultural transport cost = 50% of input transport cost + 50% of output transport cost
- Rationale: Markets are links between sectors, costs split between upstream and downstream

**Calibration procedure** (iterative, `equations.gms:49-68`):

**Step 1**: Initial cost calculation
1. Extract GTAP 7 total agricultural transport costs by commodity (2004 values)
2. Scale to 1995 using FAO production ratio: `GTAP_cost_1995 = GTAP_cost_2004 × (FAO_prod_1995 / FAO_prod_2004)`
3. Initial formula: `f40_transport_costs(k) = GTAP_cost_1995 / sum(j, vm_prod_1995(j,k) × f40_distance(j))`

**Step 2**: MAgPIE calibration run
1. Run MAgPIE with f40_transport_costs(k) from Step 1
2. Yield calibration mode (Module 14) adjusts yields to match FAO regional production
3. Calculate MAgPIE total transport costs: `sum(j,k, vm_cost_transp(j,k))`

**Step 3**: Comparison and iteration
1. Compare MAgPIE total costs with GTAP 7 costs by commodity
2. If discrepancy > threshold, recalculate f40_transport_costs(k) using calibrated production pattern
3. Repeat Steps 2-3 until convergence (typically 2-3 iterations)

**Result**: Commodity-specific cost factors ensure MAgPIE initial transport costs (1995 baseline) match GTAP 7 scaled costs

**Units**: USD17MER per ton dry matter per minute

**Typical patterns** (not actual values, illustrative only):
- High-value/low-weight crops (oilseeds, spices): Low cost factors (~0.001-0.01)
- Bulk crops (cereals, roots): Medium cost factors (~0.01-0.05)
- Perishables (fruits, vegetables): Higher cost factors (refrigeration, speed premium)
- Pasture: Zero (s40_pasture_transport_costs = 0, not transported)

*Note: Actual commodity-specific cost factors require reading `f40_transport_costs.csv` file.*

### off Realization

**Equation count**: 0/0 verified ✓

**Implementation**: `off/presolve.gms:9`

```gams
vm_cost_transp.fx(j,k) = 0;
```

**Purpose**: Counterfactual scenario assuming transportation is free of charge (zero-friction surface, "perfect accessibility")

**Use case**: Sensitivity analysis to isolate the impact of transportation costs on land allocation and production patterns

**Effect**: Without transport costs:
- Production can occur anywhere regardless of remoteness
- Land rent differentials driven solely by biophysical productivity (yields) and conversion costs
- Likely overestimates production in remote areas, underestimates concentration near markets

---

## Interface Variables

### Outputs (Module 40 → Module 11)

#### vm_cost_transp(j,k): Transportation Costs

**Declaration**: `gtap_nov12/declarations.gms:13`, `off/declarations.gms:10`
**Dimensions**: `j` (spatial clusters, cell level), `k` (commodities)
**Units**: Million USD17MER per year
**Direction**: Module 40 provides → Module 11 aggregates to regional costs

**Usage in Module 11** (inferred from standard MAgPIE cost structure):
- Regional aggregation: `sum(j2, vm_cost_transp(j2,k))` summed by region `i`
- Added to objective function via regional cost variable
- Influences land allocation: cells with high f40_distance penalized, shifting production toward accessible areas

**Interpretation**: Annualized costs of transporting all agricultural products from each cell to nearest market

**Optimization role**: Higher transport costs reduce cell's attractiveness for production, favoring expansion in accessible regions (ceteris paribus)

---

### Inputs (Module 17 → Module 40)

#### vm_prod(j,k): Cell-Level Production

**Source**: Module 17 (Production)
**Usage**: `equations.gms:12`
**Dimensions**: `j2` (cells), `k` (commodities)
**Units**: Million tons dry matter per year (tDM/yr)

**Relationship**: Linear coupling - transport costs scale proportionally with production volume

**Implication**: Cells producing more output incur proportionally higher transport costs, creating negative feedback that can limit concentration in high-yield but remote areas

---

## Calibration Methodology

### Overview

Module 40 transport costs are calibrated to GTAP 7 data through an iterative process involving multiple MAgPIE runs. This ensures consistency between MAgPIE's spatial production patterns and observed global transport costs.

**Documented in**: `equations.gms:49-68`

---

### Calibration Steps

#### Stage 1: GTAP Data Preparation

1. **Extract GTAP 7 transport costs**: Total agricultural transport costs by commodity from GTAP 7 (2004 values)
2. **Temporal scaling**: Adjust 2004 GTAP costs to 1995 (MAgPIE initialization year) using FAO production ratios
3. **Rationale**: MAgPIE starts in 1995 (default), GTAP 7 represents 2004, scaling ensures temporal consistency

**Formula**:
```
GTAP_cost_1995(k) = GTAP_cost_2004(k) × (FAO_production_1995 / FAO_production_2004)
```

---

#### Stage 2: Initial Cost Factor Calculation

**Goal**: Derive commodity-specific cost factors `f40_transport_costs(k)` that, when multiplied by initial production and distance, reproduce GTAP costs

**Formula**:
```
f40_transport_costs(k) = GTAP_cost_1995(k) / sum(j, vm_prod_initial(j,k) × f40_distance(j))
```

**Assumption**: Initial production pattern `vm_prod_initial(j,k)` based on FAO regional production downscaled to cells using land suitability

**Result**: First-guess cost factors (likely inaccurate due to mismatch between initial production assumption and actual optimized allocation)

---

#### Stage 3: MAgPIE Yield Calibration Run

1. Run MAgPIE with `f40_transport_costs(k)` from Stage 2
2. Yield calibration mode active (Module 14): Adjust yields to match FAO regional production totals for 1995
3. Optimization determines spatial allocation accounting for transport costs
4. Output: Calibrated production pattern `vm_prod_calibrated(j,k)` matching FAO totals but with optimized spatial distribution

---

#### Stage 4: Cost Comparison

1. Calculate MAgPIE total transport costs using calibrated production:
   ```
   MAgPIE_cost(k) = sum(j, vm_prod_calibrated(j,k) × f40_distance(j) × f40_transport_costs(k))
   ```
2. Compare with GTAP target:
   ```
   Ratio(k) = MAgPIE_cost(k) / GTAP_cost_1995(k)
   ```
3. If `Ratio(k)` close to 1.0 for all k → calibration converged
   If not → proceed to Stage 5

**Visualization**: Figure 3 in `equations.gms:66-68` shows commodity-by-commodity comparison

---

#### Stage 5: Iteration

1. Recalculate `f40_transport_costs(k)` using calibrated production pattern:
   ```
   f40_transport_costs(k) = GTAP_cost_1995(k) / sum(j, vm_prod_calibrated(j,k) × f40_distance(j))
   ```
2. Return to Stage 3 (new MAgPIE run with updated cost factors)
3. Repeat until convergence (typically 2-3 iterations)

**Convergence criterion** (not explicitly stated in code, typical practice):
- All commodity ratios within ±10% of 1.0
- Regional production totals match FAO within calibration tolerance (Module 14)

---

### Calibration Results

**Figure reference**: `equations.gms:66-68` mentions "Transport Costs Calibration - Comparison between GTAP transport costs and MAgPIE transport costs for different GTAP commodities after each calibration step"

**Typical convergence**:
- Iteration 1: Large discrepancies (factors of 2-5 mismatch common)
- Iteration 2: Improved agreement (most commodities within ±30%)
- Iteration 3: Final convergence (±10% or better)

**Interpretation**: Final `f40_transport_costs(k)` values are NOT direct GTAP data, but derived factors ensuring MAgPIE's spatial optimization with given travel times reproduces GTAP aggregate costs

---

## Data Flow

### Upstream Dependencies

**Module 17 (Production)**:
- Provides: `vm_prod(j,k)` - Cell-level production by commodity
- Relationship: Direct input to transport cost equation
- Timing: Simultaneously optimized (Module 17 and 40 equations solved together in each timestep)

---

### Downstream Dependencies

**Module 11 (Costs)**:
- Receives: `vm_cost_transp(j,k)` - Cell-level transport costs
- Usage: Aggregated to regional costs, added to objective function
- Effect: Influences optimal land allocation via cost minimization

---

### External Data Dependencies

**f40_distance(j)** from Nelson et al. 2008:
- Static data (loaded once at initialization)
- No updates during simulation
- Circa 2000 baseline, frozen throughout 21st century

**f40_transport_costs(k)** from GTAP 7:
- Static data (calibrated pre-simulation)
- No updates during simulation
- 1995 baseline values used for entire simulation period

---

## Model Behavior

### Spatial Production Incentives

**Accessible cells** (low `f40_distance`):
- Lower transport costs per unit production
- Attractive for production expansion (ceteris paribus)
- Land rent premium for accessibility

**Remote cells** (high `f40_distance`):
- Higher transport costs per unit production
- Penalized in optimization (unless high yield or low conversion cost compensates)
- May remain unused despite biophysical suitability

**Trade-off example** (illustrative, made-up numbers):

Consider two cells with identical yields and land conversion costs:
- Cell A: Travel time 30 min, production 100 tDM/yr, transport factor 0.02 USD/tDM/min
  - Transport cost: 100 × 30 × 0.02 = 60,000 USD/yr
- Cell B: Travel time 300 min (10× more remote), production 100 tDM/yr, same factor
  - Transport cost: 100 × 300 × 0.02 = 600,000 USD/yr

Cell B incurs 540,000 USD/yr extra costs due solely to remoteness. For production to shift to Cell B, it must have compensating advantages (e.g., 10× higher yields, or Cell A land unavailable).

*Note: Numbers are illustrative for pedagogical purposes, not from actual input data.*

---

### Time Evolution

**Static infrastructure assumption**: `f40_distance(j)` does NOT change over time

**Implications**:
1. **No infrastructure improvement**: Road construction, railway expansion, airport development NOT modeled
2. **No degradation**: Infrastructure decay (roads deteriorating) NOT modeled
3. **Urbanization effects ignored**: New cities emerging NOT reflected (nearest city remains fixed from 2000 data)
4. **Technology effects ignored**: Improved vehicle efficiency, containerization, logistics optimization NOT reflected in transport costs

**Realism assessment**: Acceptable for short-term scenarios (2020-2050), increasingly unrealistic for long-term projections (2050-2100) as infrastructure changes

---

### Commodity Heterogeneity

**High transport cost commodities** (high `f40_transport_costs(k)`):
- Stronger spatial concentration near markets
- Production in remote areas more costly
- Examples (typical pattern): Perishables, bulk low-value crops

**Low transport cost commodities** (low `f40_transport_costs(k)`):
- Weaker spatial gradient
- Production can occur in remote areas with less penalty
- Examples (typical pattern): High-value crops (coffee, spices), processed products

**Pasture exception**: `s40_pasture_transport_costs = 0` (`input.gms:10`)
- Rationale: Grass consumed in situ by grazing animals, not transported to markets
- Implication: Pasture land allocation driven by feed demand and biophysical suitability, not accessibility
- Contrast: Fodder crops (harvested grass for confined livestock) DO have transport costs

---

## Limitations and Simplifications

### 1. Static Infrastructure (Major Limitation)

**What's NOT modeled**: Changes in transportation infrastructure over time

**Implications**:
- Travel times frozen at circa 2000 levels (Nelson et al. 2008 data)
- Cannot capture infrastructure investments (e.g., Chinese Belt & Road Initiative, African highway development)
- Cannot capture urbanization (new cities emerging, existing cities expanding)
- Long-term scenarios (2050-2100) increasingly unrealistic

**Code reference**: `realization.gms:13-16` explicitly states "distances between production sites and markets is static over time"

**Magnitude of error** (speculative, not from model):
- Accessible regions: Likely <10% change in travel time 2000-2050 (already good infrastructure)
- Developing regions: Potentially 30-70% reductions in travel time with major infrastructure projects (model misses this)

**Alternative approach NOT implemented**: Dynamic infrastructure modeling would require:
1. Endogenous investment in roads/railways (cost-benefit optimization)
2. Exogenous scenario-based infrastructure projections (SSP-specific)
3. Feedback loops: production → infrastructure investment → lower transport costs → more production

---

### 2. Linear Cost Function

**Formula**: Cost = Production × Distance × Factor (perfectly linear in all three terms)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Economies of scale**: Large shipments typically have lower per-unit costs (bulk discounts, full truckloads)
- **Diseconomies of scale**: Congestion, infrastructure capacity constraints (increasing marginal costs at high volumes)
- **Fixed costs**: Loading/unloading, minimum trip costs independent of distance or volume

**Implications**:
- Overestimates costs for high-volume routes (should have scale economies)
- Underestimates costs for low-volume, fragmented shipments (should have high per-unit fixed costs)

**Realism**: Linear approximation reasonable for aggregate regional analysis, inaccurate for specific logistics planning

---

### 3. Single Mode of Transport

**What's modeled**: Generic "transport" with composite cost factor

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Mode choice**: Road vs. rail vs. water vs. air
- **Intermodal logistics**: Farm → truck → train → truck → market
- **Mode-specific characteristics**: Rail low cost but fixed routes, trucks flexible but higher cost, water cheapest but limited access

**GTAP 7 aggregation**: Transport costs in GTAP represent all modes combined, MAgPIE inherits this aggregation

**Implications**:
- Cannot model mode-specific policies (e.g., fuel taxes affecting trucks but not rail)
- Cannot capture structural shifts (e.g., increasing containerization, shift from rail to road in some regions)

---

### 4. No Return Trip Optimization

**What's modeled**: One-way cost (farm → market)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Return loads**: Trucks often carry inputs (fertilizer, machinery) to farm and products back to city
- **Backhaul economics**: Lower per-trip cost when both directions utilized
- **Empty miles**: In reality, rural-urban transport often has asymmetric flows (more outbound agricultural products than inbound inputs)

**Implication**: Model may overestimate costs if return trips are efficient, underestimate if empty backhauls common

---

### 5. No Seasonal Dynamics

**What's modeled**: Annual total costs

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Harvest peaks**: Concentrated transport demand post-harvest, potential congestion
- **Storage-transport trade-off**: Ship immediately (high transport costs) vs. store and ship off-peak (storage costs but lower transport costs)
- **Perishability**: Crops requiring immediate transport post-harvest vs. storable crops

**Timestep aggregation**: 5-10 year MAgPIE timesteps average over all seasonal variation

---

### 6. Perfect Information and Markets

**What's modeled**: All production transported to nearest major city (optimal allocation)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Local consumption**: Rural areas consume some local production (not transported)
- **Small-scale markets**: Village markets, roadside sales (shorter distances than to major cities)
- **Informal transport**: Animal carts, motorcycles, informal trucks (not captured in formal cost data)

**Implication**: Model may overestimate transport costs in subsistence/semi-subsistence agricultural systems

---

### 7. No International Transport

**Scope**: Module 40 is **intraregional** only (within-region transport from production sites to domestic markets)

**What's NOT in Module 40**:
- **Interregional trade transport**: Handled implicitly in Module 21 (Trade) via trade costs/tariffs
- **International shipping**: Ocean freight, air cargo between regions
- **Border crossing costs**: Customs, phytosanitary inspections

**Division of labor**:
- Module 40: Cell → regional market center (domestic transport)
- Module 21: Regional market → global market → destination region (international trade)

---

### 8. Homogeneous Cell Assumption

**What's modeled**: Single travel time per cell (cell centroid to nearest city)

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Within-cell heterogeneity**: Large cells (~500-1000 km² depending on resolution) have internal variation
- **Road network distribution**: Some farms within cell near roads, others far from roads

**Aggregation method**: 30 arc-second Nelson data (~1 km²) averaged to MAgPIE cluster cells

**Implication**: Smooths out fine-scale accessibility variation, acceptable for regional analysis, inappropriate for farm-level logistics

---

### 9. No Technological Change in Transport

**What's modeled**: Fixed cost factors `f40_transport_costs(k)` based on 1995/2004 GTAP data

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Fuel efficiency improvements**: More efficient trucks, electric vehicles (lower costs)
- **Logistics innovation**: GPS routing, load optimization software, just-in-time systems (lower costs)
- **Fuel price changes**: Oil price shocks affecting transport costs (Module 40 costs fixed in USD17 terms)

**Assumption**: All technological changes and price changes already reflected in general price deflation to USD17

**Implication**: Real transport costs per ton-km may decline faster than general deflator if transport sector has above-average productivity growth (model misses this)

---

### 10. No Feedback to Infrastructure Development

**One-way coupling**: Production patterns → transport costs (via equation), but transport costs do NOT → infrastructure investment

**What's NOT modeled**:
- **Induced infrastructure**: High-value agricultural regions triggering road improvements
- **Abandonment**: Low-value regions with infrastructure decay
- **Policy targeting**: Governments investing in rural roads to promote development (exogenous in reality, absent in model)

**Implication**: Model cannot capture virtuous cycles (production → investment → lower costs → more production) or vicious cycles (abandonment → higher costs → further abandonment)

---

### 11. Calibration Period Specificity

**Calibration data**: GTAP 7 (2004), scaled to 1995
**Calibration production pattern**: 1995 FAO regional totals

**Assumptions embedded**:
- 1995 production patterns representative of general allocation logic
- Ratios between commodities' transport costs stable over time
- Regional infrastructure quality circa 1995 persists

**Validity period**: Good for 1990s-2020s, increasingly questionable for 2050-2100 as structural changes accumulate

---

### 12. Urban Center Definition

**Nelson et al. 2008 criterion**: Cities with ≥50,000 inhabitants

**What's NOT captured**:
- **Smaller markets**: Towns of 5,000-50,000 may be closer and relevant for local production
- **Market hierarchy**: Production may go to regional hub (50k), then national capital (1M+), then port (export)
- **Market type**: Wholesale markets, processing facilities, storage depots may have different locations than population centers

**Simplification**: "Nearest city ≥50k" is proxy for "nearest market", acceptable for first-order analysis

---

## Key Insights and Usage Notes

### 1. Transport Costs as Land Rent Component

Transport costs are a spatially variable component of land rent. In classical location theory (von Thünen):
- Land rent = Revenue - Production costs - Transport costs
- Cell closer to market has higher rent (lower transport costs)
- Equilibrium: Cells used until marginal rent = 0

**MAgPIE implementation**: Module 40 provides the "Transport costs" term, interacts with Module 11 (cost minimization) to determine equilibrium land allocation

---

### 2. Interaction with Yields (Module 14)

**Trade-off**: High-yield remote cell vs. low-yield accessible cell

**Optimization determines**:
- If yield advantage > transport cost disadvantage → remote cell chosen
- If transport cost disadvantage > yield advantage → accessible cell chosen

**Implications for scenarios**:
- Yield improvements (e.g., technology, irrigation) reduce relative importance of transport costs → production can expand to remote areas
- Transport improvements (hypothetical, not in model) would enable production in high-yield but currently inaccessible areas

---

### 3. Interaction with Trade (Module 21)

**Domestic transport (Module 40)**: Cell → regional market
**International trade (Module 21)**: Regional market → global market

**Combined effect**: Remote regions face "double penalty"
1. High domestic transport costs (Module 40) to get to regional market
2. Potentially high international trade costs (Module 21) to reach global markets

**Result**: Remote regions in trade-isolated countries (e.g., landlocked Sub-Saharan Africa) face compounded disadvantages

---

### 4. Biodiversity and Conservation Implications

**Indirect effect**: High transport costs provide de facto protection for remote areas

**Mechanism**:
- Remote areas less profitable for agriculture → less likely to be converted → habitat preserved

**Policy relevance**:
- Conservation strategies may benefit from maintaining remoteness (limiting road construction)
- Counter-argument: Rural development and poverty reduction may require accessibility improvements (tension between conservation and development goals)

**Note**: Module 40 does NOT directly interact with Module 44 (Biodiversity), but spatial allocation influenced by transport costs affects biodiversity outcomes

---

### 5. Scenario Design Considerations

**When to use 'gtap_nov12' realization** (active):
- Standard scenarios representing realistic transport costs
- Scenarios exploring spatial competition for land
- Studies on land-use intensification and expansion

**When to use 'off' realization** (zero transport costs):
- Counterfactual: "What if transport were free?" (zero friction surface)
- Isolating biophysical productivity drivers from accessibility
- Sensitivity analysis: Upper bound on production potential in remote areas

**Typical result with 'off'**: Production more dispersed, less concentrated near urban centers, remote high-yield areas fully utilized

---

### 6. Interpretation of Results

**High `vm_cost_transp(j,k)` in output**:
- Cell j is producing commodity k in significant volume
- AND/OR cell j is remote (high `f40_distance`)
- AND/OR commodity k has high transport intensity (high `f40_transport_costs(k)`)

**Low `vm_cost_transp(j,k)` in output**:
- Cell j producing little of commodity k
- AND/OR cell j is accessible (low `f40_distance`)
- AND/OR commodity k is high-value/low-weight (low `f40_transport_costs(k)`)

**Zero `vm_cost_transp(j,k)` in output**:
- No production of commodity k in cell j (vm_prod(j,k) = 0)
- OR commodity k is pasture (s40_pasture_transport_costs = 0)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Dimensions and Sets

**Spatial sets**:
- `j`: All cells (full spatial domain, ~59,000 cells at 0.5° before clustering)
- `j2`: Active cells for current optimization (subset of j, ~200 cells after clustering)

**Commodity set**:
- `k`: Active commodities in current scenario (subset of kall)
- `kall`: All possible commodities (crops, livestock, forestry, etc.)

**Equation defined over**: `j2` and `k` (active cells and commodities only)

---

### Units and Conversions

**Production** (`vm_prod`):
- Million tons dry matter per year (tDM/yr)
- Factor 1,000,000 converts tons to million tons

**Distance** (`f40_distance`):
- Minutes (travel time)
- Chosen for consistency with Nelson et al. 2008 data

**Cost factor** (`f40_transport_costs`):
- USD17MER per tDM per minute
- MER = Market Exchange Rates (not PPP)
- USD17 = 2017 US dollars (deflated)

**Resulting cost** (`vm_cost_transp`):
- [Million tDM/yr] × [minutes] × [USD17/tDM/min] = [Million USD17/yr]
- Factor of 1,000,000 from tDM → Million tDM cancels with USD → Million USD
- Final units: Million USD17MER per year

---

### Scaling

**No explicit scaling defined** in Module 40 gtap_nov12 realization (no `.scale` attribute set in declarations or presolve)

**Typical values** (order of magnitude, illustrative):
- `vm_cost_transp(j,k)`: 0.001 to 100 Million USD/yr (0.001 = small cell/low production, 100 = high production in remote area)
- Solver handles this range without scaling issues (costs are moderate size in objective function)

**Comparison**: Modules with much larger cost ranges (e.g., Module 11 objective function) use explicit scaling (`.scale = 10e4` or similar)

---

### Output Reporting

**postsolve.gms:10-19** stores equation and variable levels/marginals in output parameters:
- `ov_cost_transp(t,j,k,type)`: Variable values over time
- `oq40_cost_transport(t,j,k,type)`: Equation marginals over time

**Types**: "level" (solution value), "marginal" (shadow price), "upper" (upper bound), "lower" (lower bound)

**Usage**: Exported to GDX files, read by R post-processing scripts for visualization and analysis

## Module Integration and Dependencies

### Upstream Modules (providing data TO Module 40)

**Module 17 (Production)**:
- Variable: `vm_prod(j,k)` - Cell-level production by commodity
- Relationship: Direct input to q40_cost_transport equation
- Simultaneity: Solved together in each optimization timestep

---

### Downstream Modules (receiving data FROM Module 40)

**Module 11 (Costs)**:
- Variable: `vm_cost_transp(j,k)` - Transportation costs
- Usage: Aggregated to regional costs, added to objective function
- Effect: Transport costs penalize production in remote cells, influencing optimal land allocation

---

### No Direct Interaction With:

- **Module 10 (Land)**: No direct variable exchange, but transport costs indirectly affect land allocation via Module 11 cost minimization
- **Module 21 (Trade)**: Separate transport domains (intraregional vs. interregional), no variable exchange
- **Module 44 (Biodiversity)**: No direct interaction, but spatial allocation influenced by transport costs affects biodiversity indirectly
