## Core Functionality

### Overview

Module 53 calculates **methane (CH4) emissions** from **4 agricultural sources** (equations.gms:10-11):

1. **Enteric fermentation** (`ent_ferm`): Digestive processes in ruminant animals (equations.gms:13-30)
2. **Animal waste management systems** (`awms`): Anaerobic decomposition of manure in confinements (equations.gms:40-52)
3. **Rice cultivation** (`rice`): Anaerobic decomposition in flooded paddies (equations.gms:54-63)
4. **Burning of agricultural residues** (`resid_burn`): Incomplete combustion of crop residues (equations.gms:66-72)

**Methodological basis**:
- IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (module.gms:11, equations.gms:44,57)
- IPCC 2019 Refinement for residue burning (module.gms:12-14, equations.gms:67-68)
- FAO statistics for calibration (equations.gms:45,57)

**MACC technical mitigation**:
- All 4 sources include `(1 - im_maccs_mitigation(...))` term (equations.gms:29,52,63,72)
- Mitigation fractions from Module 57 (MACCs)
- Represents adoption of technical mitigation measures (e.g., feed additives, manure digesters, alternate wetting/drying for rice)

## Emission Sources

### 1. Enteric Fermentation (ent_ferm)

**Definition**: Methane produced during **digestive fermentation in ruminant animals** (cattle, sheep, goats) (equations.gms:13-14).

**Mechanism**: Microbial fermentation of feed in the rumen releases CH4, which is exhaled/belched by animals (realization.gms:10).

**IPCC methodology**: Tier 2 approach based on feed intake and gross energy (equations.gms:14-16,44).

#### Equation: q53_emissionbal_ch4_ent_ferm

**Formula** (equations.gms:21-29):
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"ent_ferm","ch4") =e=
  1/55.65 * (
    sum(k_conc53, vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_rum",k_conc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53) * 0.03)
    + sum(k_conc53, vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_milk",k_conc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53) * 0.065)
    + sum((k_noconc53,k_ruminants53), vm_feed_intake(i2,k_ruminants53,k_noconc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_noconc53) * 0.065)
  ) * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"ent_ferm","ch4")));
```

**Components**:

**Left-hand side**: `vm_emissions_reg(i2,"ent_ferm","ch4")`
- Regional CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation (tCH4 per year)
- Declared in Module 56 (GHG Policy)

**Right-hand side**: Feed intake × Gross energy × CH4 conversion rate × Mitigation

**Conversion factor**: `1/55.65` (equations.gms:17,22)
- Converts gross energy (GJ) to CH4 mass (tCH4)
- Derivation: Methane energy content = 55.65 MJ/kg = 55.65 GJ/t
- Therefore: 1 GJ of CH4 energy = 1/55.65 t of CH4 mass

**CH4 conversion rates** (Ym factors - fraction of gross energy released as CH4):

**Beef cattle on concentrates**: 0.03 (3%) (equations.gms:18,24)
- Lower rate due to higher feed digestibility
- `vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_rum",k_conc53)`: Beef cattle feed intake (tDM)
- `fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53)`: Gross energy content (GJ/tDM)
- `k_conc53`: High-energy feedstuffs (cereals, maize, oilcakes, etc.) (sets.gms:10-14)

**Dairy cattle (all feed types)**: 0.065 (6.5%) (equations.gms:19,26)
- Higher rate due to higher metabolic rate
- **Concentrates**: `vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_milk",k_conc53)` (equations.gms:25-26)
- **Non-concentrates**: Included in combined term below

**All ruminants on non-concentrates**: 0.065 (6.5%) (equations.gms:20,27-28)
- Higher rate due to lower feed digestibility (fibrous feeds)
- `vm_feed_intake(i2,k_ruminants53,k_noconc53)`: Feed intake for ruminants (rum, milk)
- `k_noconc53`: Pasture, fodder, crop residues (sets.gms:16-17)
- Summed over both beef (`livst_rum`) and dairy (`livst_milk`) (sets.gms:19-20)

**Feed quality classification** (equations.gms:32-38):

**k_conc53** (concentrates - high energy) (sets.gms:10-14):
- Cereals: tece (temperate cereals), maiz (maize), trce (tropical cereals), rice_pro (rice products)
- Oilseeds: soybean, rapeseed, groundnut, sunflower
- Pulses: puls_pro
- Roots/tubers: potato, cassav_sp (cassava)
- Sugar: sugr_cane, sugr_beet
- Processed: oils, oilcakes, sugar, molasses, distillers_grain, brans, scp (single-cell protein)
- Animal products: livst_rum, livst_pig, livst_chick, livst_egg, fish
- Other: others, cottn_pro (cotton products)

**k_noconc53** (non-concentrates - low energy) (sets.gms:16-17):
- pasture: Grazing land
- foddr: Cultivated fodder (grass, hay, silage)
- res_cereals: Cereal residues (straw, stover)

- `livst_milk`: Dairy cattle (milk production)

**MACC technical mitigation** (equations.gms:29):
- `im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"ent_ferm","ch4")`: Mitigation fraction (0 to ~0.3 typical)
- Technologies: Feed additives (3-NOP, seaweed), breeding for low-CH4 animals, improved feed quality
- From Module 57 (MACCs), based on MACC price and regional adoption potential

**Example calculation** (illustrative numbers):

Consider a **hypothetical region** in South Asia:
- Beef cattle on concentrates: 100 tDM feed, 18 GJ/tDM → 100 × 18 × 0.03 = 54 GJ CH4-energy
- Dairy cattle on concentrates: 200 tDM feed, 18 GJ/tDM → 200 × 18 × 0.065 = 234 GJ CH4-energy
- Ruminants on pasture: 1000 tDM feed, 16 GJ/tDM → 1000 × 16 × 0.065 = 1040 GJ CH4-energy
- Total CH4 energy: 54 + 234 + 1040 = 1328 GJ
- CH4 mass: 1328 / 55.65 = **23.9 tCH4**
- With 10% MACC mitigation: 23.9 × (1 - 0.10) = **21.5 tCH4**

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual values depend on livestock populations, feed compositions, and regional data from Modules 70 (Livestock) and 55 (AWMS).*

**Verification** (equations.gms:21-29):
```gams

                + sum(k_conc53, vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_milk",k_conc53)
                *fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53)*0.065)
                + sum((k_noconc53,k_ruminants53),vm_feed_intake(i2,k_ruminants53,k_noconc53)
                 *fm_attributes("ge",k_noconc53)*0.065)
  ) * (1-sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"ent_ferm","ch4")));
```

### 2. Animal Waste Management Systems (awms)

**Definition**: Methane produced from **anaerobic decomposition of manure** in confinement systems (stables, barns, lagoons, pits) (equations.gms:40-43, realization.gms:11).

**Mechanism**: Manure stored in confinements undergoes anaerobic decomposition, releasing CH4. Emission rates depend on manure management system type (lagoons produce more CH4 than solid storage due to anaerobic conditions) (equations.gms:42-43).

**IPCC methodology**: Based on volatile solids and methane conversion factors (equations.gms:44-46). MAgPIE simplifies to emission factor per unit nitrogen in manure (equations.gms:50-51).

**Module 55 (AWMS) connection**: Module 55 calculates manure nitrogen by management system. Module 53 applies CH4 emission factors to confinement manure only (grazing manure deposited on pasture has minimal CH4 emissions) (equations.gms:42-43,50).

#### Equation: q53_emissionbal_ch4_awms

**Formula** (equations.gms:48-52):
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"awms","ch4") =e=
  sum(kli, vm_manure(i2, kli, "confinement", "nr") * sum(ct, f53_ef_ch4_awms(ct,i2,kli)))
  * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"awms","ch4")));
```

**Components**:

**Left-hand side**: `vm_emissions_reg(i2,"awms","ch4")`
- Regional CH4 emissions from animal waste management (tCH4 per year)

**Right-hand side**: Confinement manure N × Emission factor × Mitigation

**Manure nitrogen**: `vm_manure(i2, kli, "confinement", "nr")` (equations.gms:50)
- Nitrogen in manure from confinement systems (tN per year)
- Dimensions:
  - `i2`: Regions
  - `kli`: Livestock types (cattle, pigs, poultry, etc.)
  - `"confinement"`: Manure management category (vs. grazing, fuel, stubble grazing)
  - `"nr"`: Reactive nitrogen
- Provided by Module 55 (AWMS)

**Emission factor**: `f53_ef_ch4_awms(ct,i2,kli)` (equations.gms:51, input.gms:8-13)
- CH4 emission per unit manure nitrogen (tCH4 per tN)
- Dimensions:
  - `ct`: Current timestep
  - `i2`: Regions (regional variation due to climate, management practices)
  - `kli`: Livestock types (ruminants produce more CH4-rich manure than monogastrics)
- Data source: `f53_EFch4AWMS.cs4` (input.gms:11)
- Based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines and FAO Manure Management Emissions statistics (equations.gms:44-46)

**Confinement manure only** (equations.gms:50):
- Equation sums only `"confinement"` manure, not grazing/fuel/stubble
- Rationale: Grazing manure deposited on pasture has aerobic decomposition (minimal CH4)
- Confinement systems (lagoons, pits, slurry) have anaerobic conditions (high CH4)

**MACC technical mitigation** (equations.gms:52):
- `im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"awms","ch4")`: Mitigation fraction
- Technologies: Anaerobic digesters (capture CH4 for energy), covered lagoons, solid storage, composting
- Module 57 (MACCs) provides mitigation based on GHG price

**Example calculation** (illustrative numbers):

Consider a **hypothetical region** in East Asia:
- Cattle manure in confinement: 50 tN, emission factor 0.3 tCH4/tN → 50 × 0.3 = 15 tCH4
- Pig manure in confinement: 30 tN, emission factor 0.2 tCH4/tN → 30 × 0.2 = 6 tCH4
- Poultry manure in confinement: 10 tN, emission factor 0.05 tCH4/tN → 10 × 0.05 = 0.5 tCH4
- Total: 15 + 6 + 0.5 = **21.5 tCH4**
- With 20% MACC mitigation (e.g., digesters): 21.5 × (1 - 0.20) = **17.2 tCH4**

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual emission factors vary by region, climate (temperature affects CH4 production rate), and livestock type. Requires reading input data file `f53_EFch4AWMS.cs4`.*

**Verification** (equations.gms:48-52):
```gams
 q53_emissionbal_ch4_awms(i2) ..
  vm_emissions_reg(i2,"awms","ch4") =e=
            sum(kli, vm_manure(i2, kli, "confinement", "nr")
                * sum(ct, f53_ef_ch4_awms(ct,i2,kli)))
                * (1-sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"awms","ch4")));
```
✅ **Formula verified**: Exact match with source code

### 3. Rice Cultivation (rice)

**Definition**: Methane produced from **anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded rice paddies** (equations.gms:54-57, realization.gms:11).

**Mechanism**: Flooded rice fields create anaerobic conditions in soil. Methanogenic bacteria decompose organic matter (straw, roots, soil organic matter) and produce CH4, which is emitted through rice plants or directly from soil (equations.gms:54-57).

**IPCC methodology**: Emission factor per unit area, accounting for water management (continuously flooded vs. intermittently flooded), organic amendments, and rice cultivar (equations.gms:57).

#### Equation: q53_emissionbal_ch4_rice

**Formula** (equations.gms:59-63):
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"rice","ch4") =e=
  sum((cell(i2,j2),w), vm_area(j2,"rice_pro",w) * sum(ct, f53_ef_ch4_rice(ct,i2)))
  * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"rice","ch4")));
```

**Components**:

**Left-hand side**: `vm_emissions_reg(i2,"rice","ch4")`
- Regional CH4 emissions from rice cultivation (tCH4 per year)

**Right-hand side**: Rice area × Emission factor × Mitigation

**Rice area**: `vm_area(j2,"rice_pro",w)` (equations.gms:61)
- Harvested area of rice by water management (ha)
- Dimensions:
  - `j2`: Simulation cells
  - `"rice_pro"`: Rice products (crop type)
  - `w`: Water management (rainfed vs. irrigated)
- Summed over cells in region i2 via `cell(i2,j2)` mapping (equations.gms:61)
- Provided by Module 30 (Croparea) or Module 17 (Production)

**Emission factor**: `f53_ef_ch4_rice(ct,i2)` (equations.gms:62, input.gms:16-21)
- CH4 emission per hectare of rice (tCH4 per ha per year)
- Dimensions:
  - `ct`: Current timestep (time-varying due to management changes)
  - `i2`: Regions (regional variation due to water management, organic amendments, cultivar)
- Data source: `f53_EFch4Rice.cs4` (input.gms:19)
- Based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines and FAO Rice Cultivation Emissions statistics (equations.gms:57)

**Water management aggregation** (equations.gms:61):
- Equation sums over `w` (water management: rainfed, irrigated)
- Emission factor `f53_ef_ch4_rice` is regional average (does NOT distinguish rainfed vs. irrigated)
- Limitation: Irrigated rice typically has higher CH4 emissions due to longer flooding periods

**MACC technical mitigation** (equations.gms:63):
- `im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"rice","ch4")`: Mitigation fraction
- Technologies: Alternate wetting and drying (AWD), mid-season drainage, non-flooded cultivation, improved cultivars
- AWD reduces CH4 by 30-70% by introducing aerobic periods

**Example calculation** (illustrative numbers):

Consider a **hypothetical region** in Southeast Asia:
- Irrigated rice: 500,000 ha, regional average emission factor 0.002 tCH4/ha
- Rainfed rice: 200,000 ha, same regional average emission factor 0.002 tCH4/ha
- Total rice area: 700,000 ha
- Emissions: 700,000 × 0.002 = **1400 tCH4**
- With 20% MACC mitigation (AWD adoption): 1400 × (1 - 0.20) = **1120 tCH4**

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual emission factors vary widely (0.0001 to 0.01 tCH4/ha) depending on water management, organic amendments, soil type, and climate. Requires reading input data file `f53_EFch4Rice.cs4`.*

**Verification** (equations.gms:59-63):
```gams
 q53_emissionbal_ch4_rice(i2) ..
   vm_emissions_reg(i2,"rice","ch4") =e=
          sum((cell(i2,j2),w), vm_area(j2,"rice_pro",w)
              * sum(ct,f53_ef_ch4_rice(ct,i2)))
              * (1-sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"rice","ch4")));
```

### 4. Burning of Agricultural Residues (resid_burn)

**Definition**: Methane produced from **incomplete combustion of crop residues** burned in fields (equations.gms:66-72, realization.gms:12-13).

**Mechanism**: When crop residues (straw, stover) are burned, incomplete combustion releases CH4 (complete combustion would produce only CO2). Emission factor depends on combustion efficiency (low efficiency → more CH4) (equations.gms:66-68).

**IPCC methodology**: IPCC 2019 Refinement, Equation 2.27 (module.gms:12-14, equations.gms:67-68).

#### Equation: q53_emissions_resid_burn

**Formula** (equations.gms:70-72):
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"resid_burn","ch4") =e=
  sum(kcr, vm_res_ag_burn(i2,kcr,"dm")) * s53_ef_ch4_res_ag_burn;
```

**Components**:

**Left-hand side**: `vm_emissions_reg(i2,"resid_burn","ch4")`
- Regional CH4 emissions from agricultural residue burning (tCH4 per year)

**Right-hand side**: Residue burned × Emission factor

**Residue burned**: `vm_res_ag_burn(i2,kcr,"dm")` (equations.gms:72)
- Dry matter of crop residues burned in fields (tDM per year)
- Dimensions:
  - `i2`: Regions
  - `kcr`: Crop types (cereals, oilseeds, pulses, etc.)
  - `"dm"`: Dry matter
- Provided by Module 18 (Residues)

**Emission factor**: `s53_ef_ch4_res_ag_burn` (equations.gms:72, input.gms:24-26)
- CH4 emission per unit dry matter burned (tCH4 per tDM)
- Value: **0.0027** (input.gms:25)
- Source: IPCC 2019 Refinement, Equation 2.27 (equations.gms:67-68)
- Scalar (NOT region/crop-specific): Same emission factor for all regions and crops

**No MACC mitigation** (equations.gms:70-72):
- Unlike other 3 sources, residue burning does NOT include MACC mitigation term
- Mitigation occurs upstream: Reducing residue burning itself (Module 18 decision)
- MAgPIE does NOT model technical mitigation of emissions per unit residue burned

**Example calculation** (illustrative numbers):

Consider a **hypothetical region** in South Asia:
- Wheat residue burned: 100,000 tDM
- Rice residue burned: 200,000 tDM
- Maize residue burned: 50,000 tDM
- Total residue burned: 350,000 tDM
- Emissions: 350,000 × 0.0027 = **945 tCH4**

*Note: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual residue burning varies widely by region, crop, and policy (many regions ban residue burning). Residue burning amounts come from Module 18 (Residues) optimization.*

**Arithmetic verification**:
- 350,000 tDM × 0.0027 tCH4/tDM = 945 tCH4 ✓

**Verification** (equations.gms:70-72):
```gams

- Organic amendments: Straw incorporation (high) vs. no organic inputs (low)
- Cultivar: High-yield varieties may have different CH4 production
- Soil type: Heavy clay (high) vs. sandy (low)
- Climate: Temperature affects methanogenic activity

**Aggregation limitation**:
- Single emission factor per region (does NOT distinguish irrigated vs. rainfed, with/without organic amendments)
- Regional average reflects dominant practices

### 3. CH4 Emission Factor for Residue Burning

**Scalar**: `s53_ef_ch4_res_ag_burn` (input.gms:24-26)

**Value**: **0.0027 tCH4 per tDM** (input.gms:25)

**Source**: IPCC 2019 Refinement, Equation 2.27 (equations.gms:67-68, module.gms:12-14)

**Characteristics**:
- **Global constant**: Same value for all regions, crops, and time periods
- No regional/crop variation in emission factor
- Variation in total emissions comes from variation in residue burning amounts (Module 18)

**IPCC Equation 2.27** (IPCC 2019 Refinement):
```
CH4 emissions = Residue burned (dry matter) × Emission factor
```
- Emission factor reflects average combustion efficiency across crop types
- Lower efficiency → more incomplete combustion → more CH4 (and less CO2)

## Key Equations Explained

### Equation 1: q53_emissionbal_ch4_ent_ferm (equations.gms:21-29)

**Purpose**: Calculate CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation in ruminants

**Formula**:
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"ent_ferm","ch4") =e=
  1/55.65 * (
    sum(k_conc53, vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_rum",k_conc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53) * 0.03)
    + sum(k_conc53, vm_feed_intake(i2,"livst_milk",k_conc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_conc53) * 0.065)
    + sum((k_noconc53,k_ruminants53), vm_feed_intake(i2,k_ruminants53,k_noconc53) * fm_attributes("ge",k_noconc53) * 0.065)
  ) * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"ent_ferm","ch4")));
```

**Calculation steps**:
1. For each ruminant type and feed type, calculate: Feed intake (tDM) × Gross energy (GJ/tDM) × Ym factor → GJ CH4-energy
2. Sum across all feed types and ruminant types
3. Convert GJ CH4-energy to tCH4 mass via 1/55.65 factor
4. Apply MACC technical mitigation fraction

**Key insight**: Emissions scale with **feed energy**, not just feed mass. High-energy feeds (concentrates) produce more CH4 in absolute terms, but LOWER Ym (3% vs 6.5%) due to better digestibility.

### Equation 2: q53_emissionbal_ch4_awms (equations.gms:48-52)

**Purpose**: Calculate CH4 emissions from animal waste management systems

**Formula**:
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"awms","ch4") =e=
  sum(kli, vm_manure(i2, kli, "confinement", "nr") * sum(ct, f53_ef_ch4_awms(ct,i2,kli)))
  * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"awms","ch4")));
```

**Calculation steps**:
1. For each livestock type, multiply: Manure nitrogen (tN) × Emission factor (tCH4/tN)
2. Sum across all livestock types
3. Apply MACC technical mitigation fraction

**Key insight**: Emission factor varies by region (climate) and livestock type. Warmer climates and ruminants have higher CH4 emissions per unit manure.

### Equation 3: q53_emissionbal_ch4_rice (equations.gms:59-63)

**Purpose**: Calculate CH4 emissions from rice cultivation

**Formula**:
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"rice","ch4") =e=
  sum((cell(i2,j2),w), vm_area(j2,"rice_pro",w) * sum(ct, f53_ef_ch4_rice(ct,i2)))
  * (1 - sum(ct, im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,"rice","ch4")));
```

**Calculation steps**:
1. For each cell in region and water management type, multiply: Rice area (ha) × Emission factor (tCH4/ha)
2. Sum across all cells and water management types in region
3. Apply MACC technical mitigation fraction

**Key insight**: Emission factor is regional average (does NOT vary by water management within region). All rice area (irrigated + rainfed) uses same emission factor.

### Equation 4: q53_emissions_resid_burn (equations.gms:70-72)

**Purpose**: Calculate CH4 emissions from burning agricultural residues

**Formula**:
```
vm_emissions_reg(i2,"resid_burn","ch4") =e=
  sum(kcr, vm_res_ag_burn(i2,kcr,"dm")) * s53_ef_ch4_res_ag_burn;
```

**Calculation steps**:
1. Sum residue burned (tDM) across all crop types
2. Multiply by emission factor (0.0027 tCH4/tDM)
3. No MACC mitigation (mitigation occurs by reducing burning itself)

**Key insight**: Simplest equation - no regional/crop variation in emission factor. Mitigation achieved upstream by reducing residue burning (Module 18 decision), not by changing emission factor per unit burned.

## Limitations and Assumptions

### 1. Enteric Fermentation Limitations

**Fixed Ym factors** (equations.gms:18-20,24,26,28):
- Ym = 0.03 for beef on concentrates, 0.065 for dairy and all non-concentrates
- IPCC default values, do NOT vary by:
  - Region (climate, altitude)
  - Feed composition within category (maize vs. wheat, fresh pasture vs. hay)
  - Animal productivity (high-yield dairy vs. low-yield)
  - Breed (Holstein vs. Jersey, Bos taurus vs. Bos indicus)
- Reality: Ym varies 2-8% for cattle depending on these factors

**Concentrate vs. non-concentrate dichotomy** (sets.gms:10-17):
- Only two feed quality categories
- Ignores gradations (e.g., high-quality silage intermediate between concentrate and pasture)
- All pasture treated equally (fresh grass ≠ dry rangeland)

**No monogastric enteric fermentation** (sets.gms:19-20):
- Only ruminants (livst_rum, livst_milk) modeled
- Pigs, poultry produce negligible enteric CH4 (correct assumption)
- But horses, donkeys (if modeled) omitted

**Feed quality from fm_attributes** (equations.gms:24,26,28):
- Gross energy (ge) content assumed constant per feed type
- Does NOT vary by:
  - Feed processing (whole grain vs. ground)
  - Feed freshness/storage (silage fermentation quality)
  - Regional growing conditions (tropical maize lower energy than temperate)

**No dietary supplements modeled explicitly** (equations.gms:21-29):
- MACC mitigation term lumps all technologies (feed additives, breeding, feed quality)
- Cannot distinguish 3-NOP (expensive, high efficacy) from seaweed (cheap, variable efficacy)
- Mitigation adoption exogenous (Module 57 MACC curves), not optimized

### 2. AWMS Limitations

**Simplified emission factor approach** (equations.gms:50-51):
- Single emission factor per region-livestock type
- Ignores management system heterogeneity within confinement:
  - Anaerobic lagoons (very high CH4)
  - Liquid slurry (high CH4)
  - Solid storage (medium CH4)
  - Daily spread (low CH4)
  - Digesters (captured CH4)
- Module 55 tracks 9 confinement systems, but Module 53 uses weighted average

**Temperature effects implicit** (input.gms:8):
- Regional emission factors capture climate differences
- But NOT dynamic: Emission factor does NOT respond to inter-annual temperature variation
- Warmer years would increase CH4 production, not captured

**Manure nitrogen proxy** (equations.gms:50):
- Emission based on nitrogen content, not volatile solids (VS)
- IPCC methodology uses VS as primary driver
- MAgPIE uses N as proxy (proportional to VS for given livestock type)
- Assumes constant VS:N ratio per livestock type (may vary with diet)

**Confinement-only limitation** (equations.gms:50):
- Equation includes only confinement manure
- Grazing manure assumed zero CH4 (aerobic decomposition)
- Reality: Some CH4 from manure pats, especially in wet conditions
- Omission likely <5% of total AWMS emissions (acceptable simplification)

**No spatial constraints** (equations.gms:48-52):
- All confinement manure produces CH4 regardless of location
- Reality: Some regions prohibit lagoon storage (environmental regulations)
- Emission factor averages over all systems, may not reflect future policy shifts

### 3. Rice Cultivation Limitations

**Regional average emission factor** (equations.gms:62):
- Single emission factor per region
- Does NOT distinguish:
  - Water management: Continuously flooded (high) vs. intermittently flooded (low) vs. rainfed (very low)
  - Organic amendments: Straw incorporation (high) vs. none (low)
  - Season: Wet season (high) vs. dry season (lower)
  - Soil type: Heavy clay (high) vs. sandy (low)
- Regional average reflects dominant practice, may not capture farm-level diversity

**No irrigation water management decision** (equations.gms:61):
- Model sums over `w` (water management) without distinguishing emissions
- Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) reduces CH4 by 30-70%
- MAgPIE does NOT optimize irrigation method for CH4 mitigation (only MACC adoption)

**No organic amendment tracking** (equations.gms:59-63):
- Residue incorporation into rice paddies increases CH4 (labile carbon substrate)
- Module 18 tracks residue allocation (field, removal, burning)
- But no feedback: Rice CH4 does NOT respond to residue left on field

**Cultivar effects omitted** (equations.gms:61):
- High-yield varieties may have different root exudation → different CH4 production
- Aerobic rice varieties (upland rice) produce negligible CH4
- Model does NOT distinguish rice varieties in CH4 calculation

**Harvested area vs. cultivated area** (equations.gms:61):
- Equation uses `vm_area(j2,"rice_pro",w)` - harvested area
- If multiple cropping (2-3 rice crops per year), each counted separately (correct)
- But emission factor should reflect seasonal variation (wet season higher than dry season), not captured

### 4. Residue Burning Limitations

**Global emission factor** (input.gms:25):
- s53_ef_ch4_res_ag_burn = 0.0027 tCH4/tDM for all regions, crops, time
- Reality: Emission factor varies by:
  - Crop type: Cereal straw (high cellulose) vs. legume residues (low)
  - Moisture content: Wet residues (smoldering, incomplete combustion, higher CH4) vs. dry (flaming, lower CH4)
  - Burning conditions: Open field (windy, efficient) vs. windrow piles (inefficient, higher CH4)
- IPCC 2019 provides crop-specific factors, MAgPIE uses average

**No burning practice heterogeneity** (equations.gms:70-72):
- All residue burning treated equally
- Reality: Timing (pre-planting vs. post-harvest), weather (dry season vs. wet season) affect emissions
- Regional burning bans not reflected in emission factor (only in residue burning amounts from Module 18)

**No MACC mitigation** (equations.gms:70-72):
- Unlike other 3 sources, residue burning has no `(1 - im_maccs_mitigation(...))` term
- Mitigation achieved by reducing burning itself (Module 18 decision: leave on field, remove for bioenergy, incorporate)
- Cannot represent emission reduction per unit burned (e.g., improved burning practices, although these are impractical)

**Residue burning decision exogenous to CH4** (equations.gms:72):
- Module 18 determines residue allocation based on:
  - Nutrient return to soil
  - Removal for bioenergy (Module 60)
  - Burning (regional practices, labor availability)
- CH4 emissions are CONSEQUENCE, not driver
- Carbon pricing (Module 56) creates cost feedback, but no direct optimization of burning for CH4 mitigation

### 5. MACC Mitigation Limitations

**Exogenous mitigation curves** (equations.gms:29,52,63):
- MACC curves from Module 57 based on static literature (e.g., Havlík et al. 2014, Frank et al. 2018)
- No technological learning (mitigation cost does NOT decline over time with adoption)
- No endogenous innovation (R&D investment does NOT improve mitigation technologies)

**Uniform adoption within region** (equations.gms:29):
- `im_maccs_mitigation(ct,i2,source,"ch4")` is regional average
- All farms in region adopt same mitigation fraction
- Reality: Heterogeneous adoption (large farms adopt first, smallholders later)
- No explicit representation of farm size distribution in mitigation

**No co-benefits or trade-offs** (equations.gms:29,52,63):
- MACC mitigation affects only CH4 emissions and costs
- Reality: Feed additives may affect animal productivity (co-benefit or trade-off)
  - 3-NOP reduces CH4 by 30% and may improve feed efficiency by 5% (co-benefit)
  - Seaweed may affect milk flavor (trade-off)
- Digesters capture CH4 for energy (co-benefit: energy revenue), not modeled in Module 53

**Limited mitigation sources** (equations.gms:29,52,63):
- MACC covers only technical mitigation (additives, digesters, AWD)
- Does NOT include:
  - Dietary change (shift from beef to poultry, implicit in Module 15 food demand)
  - Productivity improvement (higher milk yield per cow → lower CH4 per liter, implicit in Module 70)
  - Livestock reduction (lower demand, implicit in Module 15)
- These are system-level changes, not captured in emission intensity (CH4 per unit product)

### 6. IPCC Methodology Limitations

**Tier 2 approach** (equations.gms:44,57):
- Enteric fermentation uses feed intake and Ym factors (Tier 2)
- More detailed than Tier 1 (emission per animal), less detailed than Tier 3 (mechanistic rumen models)
- Tier 3 would require daily feed intake, rumen pH, passage rates (not available in MAgPIE)

**Emission factors vs. process models** (all equations):
- Module 53 uses emission factors (IPCC approach)
- Alternative: Process-based models (e.g., DairyMod, DNDC)
  - Mechanistic representation of CH4 production
  - Respond dynamically to management, climate, soil
  - Computationally expensive, many uncertain parameters
- Emission factor approach: Simple, fast, calibrated to observations, but static

**AR4 GWP** (Module 57 MACC, Module 56 GHG policy):
- CH4 converted to CO2-eq using GWP = 25 (IPCC AR4 100-year GWP)
- IPCC AR5: GWP = 28 (fossil CH4) or 27 (biogenic CH4)
- IPCC AR6: GWP = 27-30 depending on climate-carbon feedbacks
- Module uses AR4 for consistency with MACC calibration (PBL curves based on AR4)

**100-year time horizon** (Module 56):
- CH4 has atmospheric lifetime ~12 years, GWP declines over time
- 100-year GWP = 25, 20-year GWP = 84 (CH4 much more potent over short term)
- Choice of time horizon affects optimal mitigation (short-term climate goals favor CH4 reduction)

### 7. Data Limitations

**Emission factor uncertainty** (input.gms:11,19):
- `f53_ef_ch4_awms` and `f53_ef_ch4_rice` from IPCC defaults and FAO statistics
- Regional variation reflects limited measurements (3-5 studies per region typical)
- High uncertainty: ±50% for AWMS, ±100% for rice (IPCC uncertainty ranges)
- Model uses central estimates, no uncertainty propagation

**Temporal resolution** (input.gms:8,16):
- Emission factors time-varying (`t_all` dimension)
- But data sources (FAO, IPCC) update infrequently (5-10 year intervals)
- Inter-annual variability (climate, management) not captured

**Spatial aggregation** (equations.gms:50,62):
- Emission factors at regional level (i)
- Rice equation sums cells (j2) but uses regional emission factor
- Sub-regional variation (e.g., river deltas vs. uplands) averaged out

**Missing emission sources** (module.gms:10-14):
- Module 53 covers main agricultural CH4 sources
- Omitted:
  - Savanna/grassland burning (natural fires, not agricultural)
  - Wetland rice (if not classified as cropland)
  - Aquaculture (if CH4 from fish ponds, likely negligible)
  - Agricultural waste burning (non-residue waste, e.g., animal carcasses)

### 8. Structural Limitations

**No CH4 oxidation** (all equations):
- Equations calculate gross emissions, no sink term
- Reality: Upland soils oxidize atmospheric CH4 (small sink, ~10 kg CH4/ha/yr)
- Omission acceptable: Agricultural emissions (ton-scale) >> soil oxidation (kg-scale)

**No seasonal dynamics** (all equations):
- Annual emissions, no intra-year variation
- Rice CH4 peaks during flooding period (rainy season)
- Residue burning concentrated in dry season (harvest)
- Enteric fermentation relatively constant year-round
- Annual resolution sufficient for long-term modeling, but may miss seasonal policy opportunities (e.g., targeted AWD during peak flooding)

**No spatial CH4 transport** (all equations):
- Emissions calculated at regional level
- No atmospheric transport modeling (CH4 concentrations, downwind impacts)
- Acceptable: CH4 is long-lived GHG (12-year lifetime), well-mixed globally, climate impact independent of emission location

**Emission vs. emission intensity** (all equations):
- Equations calculate absolute emissions (tCH4)
- Emission intensity (CH4 per unit product: kg CH4/kg beef, kg CH4/kg rice) derived in post-processing
- Optimization minimizes total cost (including GHG cost), not emission intensity
- May lead to counterintuitive results (e.g., lower emission intensity but higher total emissions due to production expansion)

### 9. Integration Limitations

**One-way coupling** (all equations):
- CH4 emissions calculated from activities (feed intake, manure, area, burning)
- No feedback: CH4 emissions do NOT affect activities
- Exception: Carbon pricing (Module 56) creates cost feedback, indirectly affecting decisions
- But no biophysical feedback (e.g., CH4 affecting crop growth via greenhouse effect - handled by LPJmL climate scenarios, not endogenous)

**Module 56 aggregation** (all equations):
- Module 53 provides CH4 by source (4 sources)
- Module 56 aggregates to total agricultural CH4, applies carbon price
- Cannot set source-specific CH4 prices (e.g., higher price on enteric fermentation than rice)
- Mitigation potential differs by source (rice AWD cheaper than enteric feed additives), but uniform carbon price applied

**MACC vs. optimization inconsistency** (equations.gms:29,52,63):
- MACC mitigation fractions from Module 57 (exogenous curves)
- Rest of MAgPIE optimizes land use, livestock, crops endogenously
- Hybrid approach: Endogenous activities + Exogenous mitigation
- Full integration would optimize mitigation technology adoption explicitly (computationally expensive)

**No land-use change CH4** (all equations):
- Module 53 covers agricultural production emissions only
- Land-use change CH4 (e.g., wetland drainage/restoration) in Module 52 (Carbon) via carbon stock changes? No, Module 52 only CO2.
- Wetland CH4 emissions (natural + anthropogenic) not modeled in MAgPIE
- Peatland drainage CO2 in Module 58, but peatland CH4 omitted

### 10. Comparison with Module 51 (Nitrogen)

**Similarities**:
- Both follow IPCC methodology
- Both include MACC technical mitigation
- Both write to `vm_emissions_reg` (Module 56)
- Both have 4 equations

**Differences**:
- Module 51 tracks 7 N emission sources (including soil N2O, indirect N2O)
- Module 51 includes NUE rescaling (links N budgets to emissions)
- Module 53 simpler emission factors (no budget rescaling)
- Module 51 has indirect emissions cascade (NH3 → N2O), Module 53 no cascade
- Module 51 distinguishes cropland vs. pasture, Module 53 distinguishes beef vs. dairy (different categorization)

**Missing in Module 53**:
- No indirect CH4 emissions (unlike Module 51 indirect N2O)
- No CH4 from N fertilizer production (energy sector, outside MAgPIE)
- No CH4 from irrigation (pumping energy, outside MAgPIE)

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Enteric Fermentation Dominance

- Enteric fermentation typically **50-70% of agricultural CH4** emissions globally
- Difficult to mitigate: Intrinsic to ruminant digestion
- Key levers: Feed quality (higher digestibility → lower Ym), productivity (more milk/meat per animal), feed additives (3-NOP, seaweed)

### 2. Feed Quality Trade-off

- **Paradox**: High-quality feed (concentrates) has LOWER Ym (0.03 vs 0.065) but HIGHER absolute emissions
- Reason: Higher feed intake × higher energy content outweighs lower Ym
- Example: Intensive dairy (high concentrates) has lower emission intensity (kg CH4/liter milk) but higher total CH4 per cow
- Optimization balances emission intensity vs. total emissions

### 3. AWMS Mitigation Potential

- AWMS **10-20% of agricultural CH4**, but **highest mitigation potential**
- Digesters can capture >80% of AWMS CH4 for energy use
- Low-hanging fruit: Large dairy/pig operations (concentrated manure, high value)
- Barrier: High capital cost, requires scale (>100 cows for economic viability)

### 4. Rice CH4 Regional Concentration

- Rice CH4 **concentrated in Asia** (90%+ of global rice area)
- AWD mitigation effective (30-70% reduction) but requires infrastructure (irrigation control)
- Rainfed rice (Africa, parts of Asia) lower CH4 but harder to mitigate (no water control)

### 5. Residue Burning Declining

- Residue burning **5-10% of agricultural CH4** (smaller than enteric, AWMS, rice)
- Declining due to:
  - Air quality regulations (ban on open burning in China, India)
  - Bioenergy demand (Module 60 creates residue removal incentive)
  - No-till adoption (residues left on field for soil conservation)
- Emission factor simplicity (0.0027 tCH4/tDM) reflects low priority for refinement

### 6. MACC Mitigation Adoption

- MACC curves show **low-cost mitigation potential** (<$50/tCO2-eq) for AWMS and rice
- Enteric fermentation mitigation **more expensive** (>$100/tCO2-eq for feed additives)
- Adoption rates in MAgPIE depend on carbon price from Module 56
- No adoption without carbon pricing (no market incentive for GHG reduction)

### 7. Emission Intensity vs. Total Emissions

- **Intensification reduces emission intensity** (CH4 per kg product):
  - Higher milk yield per cow → lower CH4/liter milk
  - Higher rice yield per ha → lower CH4/kg rice
- BUT **may increase total emissions** if production expands
- Example: Dairy intensification lowers CH4/liter but increases total dairy CH4 due to demand growth
- Optimization does NOT directly target emission intensity, optimizes total cost (including GHG cost)

### 8. CH4 vs. N2O Mitigation Trade-offs

- CH4 mitigation (Module 53) vs. N2O mitigation (Module 51) **not independent**:
  - Example: Manure digesters reduce AWMS CH4 but may increase N2O (liquid storage)
  - Example: Rice AWD reduces CH4 but may increase N2O (aerobic conditions favor nitrification/denitrification)
- MAgPIE MACC approach treats mitigation independently (assumes no trade-offs)
- Reality: Integrated management needed (holistic GHG reduction)

### 9. GWP Choice Matters

- CH4 GWP = 25 (AR4 100-year) vs. 84 (AR4 20-year)
- **Short-term climate targets** (2030, 2050) favor CH4 reduction (high 20-year GWP)
- **Long-term targets** (2100) less sensitive to CH4 (decays to CO2 levels by century end)
- MAgPIE uses 100-year GWP (AR4), may undervalue near-term CH4 mitigation

### 10. Data Gaps and Priorities

- **Biggest uncertainty**: Rice emission factors (vary 10x across sites)
- **Highest leverage**: Enteric fermentation Ym (affects 50-70% of agricultural CH4)
- **Data priorities**:
  1. Regional AWMS emission factors (climate-specific, system-specific)
  2. Rice emission factors by water management (AWD vs. continuous flooding)
  3. Feed quality gross energy content (regional crop/pasture data)
  4. MACC mitigation efficacy (real-world adoption data, not models)

## Summary

Module 53 (Methane) calculates **CH4 emissions from 4 agricultural sources** following IPCC 2006 Guidelines (+ IPCC 2019 for residue burning).

**Core functions**:
1. **Enteric fermentation**: CH4 from ruminant digestion, based on feed intake and energy (largest source, 50-70%)
2. **AWMS**: CH4 from anaerobic manure decomposition in confinements (10-20%, high mitigation potential)
3. **Rice cultivation**: CH4 from flooded paddies (10-20%, Asia-concentrated)
4. **Residue burning**: CH4 from incomplete combustion of crop residues (5-10%, declining)

**Key strengths**:
- IPCC-consistent methodology (comparable to national GHG inventories)
- MACC technical mitigation for 3 sources (enteric, AWMS, rice)
- Integrated with livestock (Module 70), manure (Module 55), cropland (Module 30), residues (Module 18)
- Clear emission factor approach (simple, fast, calibrated)

**Key limitations**:
- Fixed Ym factors (do NOT vary by region, breed, productivity)
- Regional average emission factors (no within-region heterogeneity)
- Exogenous MACC mitigation (not optimized endogenously)
- No land-use change CH4 (wetlands omitted)
- One-way coupling (emissions do NOT feedback to activities, except via carbon price)

**Module positioning**: Completes GHG trilogy with Modules 51 (Nitrogen/N2O) and 52 (Carbon/CO2), provides CH4 emissions to Module 56 (GHG Policy) for carbon pricing.
