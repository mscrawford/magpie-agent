# Module 55: AWMS (Animal Waste Management Systems) (ipcc2006_aug16)

**Status**: ✅ Fully Verified (2025-10-12)
**Realization**: `ipcc2006_aug16`
**Equations**: 7
**Citation Coverage**: 100+ file:line references

---

## Purpose

Module 55 calculates **nutrient (N, P, K) flows within animal waste management systems** using a mass balance approach (`module.gms:10`, `realization.gms:9-10`). The module receives feed intake data from Module 70 (Livestock) and provides manure flows to Module 50 (NR Soil Budget) and emission source data to Modules 51 (Nitrogen) and 53 (Methane) (`module.gms:11-13`).

**Core Methodology**: Uses IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (`realization.gms:11-12`) and mass balance calculations from Bodirsky et al. (2012) (`realization.gms:10`).

---

## Equations (7)

### Conceptual Framework

The module distinguishes **4 general animal waste management systems** based on **what animals eat** and **where their manure remains** (`equations.gms:13-23`):

1. **Confinement**: Animals receive concentrate feed and crop residues (manure managed in facilities)
2. **Grazing**: Animals graze pasture (manure stays on pastures)
3. **Fuel**: Animals graze pasture (manure collected as household fuel)
4. **Stubble Grazing**: Animals graze crop residues on harvested fields

**Simplifying Assumptions** (`equations.gms:15-22`):
- Pastures receive manure from grazed biomass
- Croplands receive manure from crop-based feed
- Grass harvested and fed in stables + manure from confinements applied to pastures assumed to cancel out (primarily occurs in high-income countries)

---

### Feed Intake Allocation Equations (4)

#### 1. Confinement Feed Intake

**`q55_bal_intake_confinement(i,kli,npk)`** (`equations.gms:26-33`)

Calculates nutrient intake for confined animals receiving **concentrate feed, crop residues, and byproducts**.

**Formula**:
```gams
v55_feed_intake(i2, kli, "confinement",npk) =e=
sum(kcr,vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,kcr) * fm_attributes(npk,kcr))
+ sum(kap,vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,kap) * fm_attributes(npk,kap))
+ sum(ksd,vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,ksd) * fm_attributes(npk,ksd))
+ sum(kres,vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,kres) * fm_attributes(npk,kres)
    *(1-(1-sum(ct,im_development_state(ct,i2)))*0.25))
```

**Components**:
- `kcr`: Crops (cereals, oilseeds, etc.) fed to animals (`equations.gms:28`)
- `kap`: Animal products (fishmeal, dairy byproducts) (`equations.gms:29`)
- `ksd`: Seeds and plant-based byproducts (`equations.gms:30`)
- `kres`: Crop residues fed in confinement (`equations.gms:31-32`)

**Development State Adjustment** (`equations.gms:31-32`):
- **Developed regions** (`im_development_state = 1`): All residues fed in confinement → factor = 1
- **Developing regions** (`im_development_state = 0`): 25% of residues grazed on stubble fields → factor = 0.75
- Arithmetic: `1 - (1-1)*0.25 = 1` (developed), `1 - (1-0)*0.25 = 0.75` (developing) ✓

**Purpose**: Separates residue feeding between confinement (fed in stables) and stubble grazing (grazed in fields) based on development status.

---

#### 2. Grazing on Pasture (Manure Stays)

**`q55_bal_intake_grazing_pasture(i,kli,npk)`** (`equations.gms:37-41`)

Calculates nutrient intake for animals grazing pasture where **manure remains on pasture**.

**Formula**:
```gams
v55_feed_intake(i2, kli, "grazing",npk) =e=
(vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,"pasture")) * fm_attributes(npk,"pasture")
*(1-ic55_manure_fuel_shr(i2,kli))
```

**Components**:
- `vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,"pasture")`: Pasture biomass consumed (from Module 70) (`equations.gms:39`)
- `fm_attributes(npk,"pasture")`: Nutrient content of pasture (N/P/K per unit DM)
- `ic55_manure_fuel_shr(i2,kli)`: Share of manure collected for household fuel (0-1) (`equations.gms:40`)

**Manure Fate**: Manure from this AWMS category stays on pasture (contributes to pasture nutrient cycling, emissions calculated in Module 51).

---

#### 3. Grazing on Pasture (Manure Collected for Fuel)

**`q55_bal_intake_fuel(i,kli,npk)`** (`equations.gms:44-48`)

Calculates nutrient intake for animals grazing pasture where **manure is collected as household fuel** (common in developing regions).

**Formula**:
```gams
v55_feed_intake(i2, kli, "fuel",npk) =e=
(vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,"pasture")) * fm_attributes(npk,"pasture")
*sum(ct,ic55_manure_fuel_shr(i2,kli))
```

**Distinction from Grazing AWMS**:
- **Grazing**: Manure left on pasture → factor = `(1 - fuel_share)`
- **Fuel**: Manure collected → factor = `fuel_share`
- Together: `(1 - fuel_share) + fuel_share = 1` → all pasture manure accounted ✓

**Cultural/Economic Context**: Dried manure used as cooking/heating fuel in regions with limited fuelwood access (e.g., South Asia, parts of Sub-Saharan Africa).

---

#### 4. Stubble Grazing on Cropland

**`q55_bal_intake_grazing_cropland(i,kli,npk)`** (`equations.gms:52-56`)

Calculates nutrient intake for animals grazing **crop residues on harvested fields**.

**Formula**:
```gams
v55_feed_intake(i2, kli, "stubble_grazing",npk) =e=
sum(kres,vm_feed_intake(i2,kli,kres) * fm_attributes(npk,kres)
*(1 - sum(ct,im_development_state(ct,i2)))*0.25)
```

**Development State Split** (`equations.gms:58-61`):
- **Developing regions**: 25% of residues grazed on stubble fields
- **Developed regions**: 0% (all residues fed in confinement or burned)

**Consistency Check** (`equations.gms:58-61`):
- Confinement residues (Eq. 1): `1 - (1-dev_state)*0.25`
- Stubble grazing (Eq. 4): `(1 - dev_state)*0.25`
- Sum: `1 - (1-dev_state)*0.25 + (1-dev_state)*0.25 = 1` ✓

**Manure Fate**: Manure from stubble grazing deposited on cropland (contributes to cropland nutrient cycling).

---

### Manure Calculation Equations (3)

#### 5. General Manure Balance

**`q55_bal_manure(i,kli,awms,npk)`** (`equations.gms:68-71`)

Calculates **manure excretion** for each AWMS using a **mass balance approach** (`equations.gms:63-66`).

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_manure(i2, kli, awms,npk) =e=
v55_feed_intake(i2, kli, awms,npk)
*(1-sum(ct,im_slaughter_feed_share(ct,i2,kli,npk)))
```

**Mass Balance Principle**:
```
Manure NPK = Feed NPK - NPK incorporated into animal biomass
```

**Components**:
- `v55_feed_intake(i2,kli,awms,npk)`: Nutrient intake by AWMS (from Equations 1-4)
- `im_slaughter_feed_share(ct,i2,kli,npk)`: Share of feed nutrients retained in animal biomass (meat, milk, eggs) (`equations.gms:71`)

**Slaughter Feed Share** (`equations.gms:64-66`):
- Calculated in preprocessing (computational efficiency)
- Depends on animal productivity (high productivity → higher retention share)
- Example (illustrative): Broiler chickens ~15% retention, dairy cattle ~5% retention (actual values vary by region and productivity)

**Note**: These are made-up numbers for illustration. Actual `im_slaughter_feed_share` values are preprocessed outside GAMS.

---

#### 6. Confinement System Distribution

**`q55_manure_confinement(i,kli,awms_conf,npk)`** (`equations.gms:75-78`)

Distributes confinement manure across **9 animal waste management systems** (`equations.gms:73-74`).

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_manure_confinement(i2,kli,awms_conf, npk) =e=
vm_manure(i2, kli, "confinement", npk) * ic55_awms_shr(i2,kli,awms_conf)
```

**9 Confinement Systems** (`sets.gms:16-17`):
1. **lagoon**: Anaerobic lagoon storage
2. **liquid_slurry**: Liquid manure (slurry) storage
3. **solid_storage**: Solid manure stockpiling
4. **drylot**: Open feedlot (uncovered)
5. **daily_spread**: Daily application to fields (no storage)
6. **digester**: Anaerobic digester (biogas production)
7. **other**: Uncategorized systems
8. **pit_short**: Short-term pit storage (<1 month)
9. **pit_long**: Long-term pit storage (>1 month)

**AWMS Shares** (`ic55_awms_shr`):
- Scenario-dependent (SSP1-5, SRES, GoodPractice) (`presolve.gms:23-24`)
- Region-specific (reflects infrastructure, climate, economics)
- Livestock-specific (e.g., dairy vs. poultry have different management)
- Sum constraint: `sum(awms_conf, ic55_awms_shr(i,kli,awms_conf)) = 1` (all confinement manure allocated)

---

#### 7. Manure Recycling to Cropland

**`q55_manure_recycling(i,npk)`** (`equations.gms:83-87`)

Calculates **total manure recycled to cropland** from all confinement systems (`equations.gms:80-82`).

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_manure_recycling(i2,npk) =e=
sum((awms_conf,kli),
    vm_manure_confinement(i2,kli,awms_conf, npk)
    * i55_manure_recycling_share(i2,kli,awms_conf,npk))
```

**Recycling Shares** (`i55_manure_recycling_share`):
- **Nitrogen**: System-specific (0-1), accounts for losses during storage/handling (`preloop.gms:10`)
- **Phosphorus**: Fixed at 1.0 (100% recycled, no losses assumed) (`preloop.gms:12`)
- **Potassium**: Fixed at 1.0 (100% recycled, no losses assumed) (`preloop.gms:13`)

**Nitrogen Loss Pathways**:
- Volatilization (NH₃, NOₓ) during storage → emissions to atmosphere
- Leaching (NO₃⁻) from lagoons/pits → losses to groundwater
- Denitrification (N₂, N₂O) in anaerobic conditions → gaseous losses
- Recycling share = 1 - (volatilization + leaching + denitrification fractions)

**P and K Assumption** (`preloop.gms:11`): No leaching or volatilization losses (highly simplified, actual P runoff from lagoons not modeled).

**Output**: `vm_manure_recycling` provided to Module 50 (NR Soil Budget) as manure nutrient input to cropland.

```

**Interpretation**:
- `p55_region_shr = 1`: All countries in region under selected scenario
- `p55_region_shr = 0`: No countries in region under selected scenario (use fallback)
- `0 < p55_region_shr < 1`: Mixed (e.g., 60% of region's population in selected countries → 60% scenario weight)

---

## Execution Phases

### preloop (`preloop.gms:10-13`)

**Recycling Share Initialization**:
- Load nitrogen recycling shares from input file for all confinement systems (`preloop.gms:10`)
- Fix phosphorus recycling at 100% (no losses assumption) (`preloop.gms:12`)
- Fix potassium recycling at 100% (no losses assumption) (`preloop.gms:13`)

**Rationale**: P and K volatilization/leaching negligible compared to N losses (simplification for computational efficiency and data availability).

### presolve (`presolve.gms:8-26`)

**Country Selection Setup** (`presolve.gms:11-12`):
```gams
p55_country_switch(iso) = 0
p55_country_switch(scen_countries55) = 1
```

**Regional Share Calculation** (`presolve.gms:16`):
- Population-weighted aggregation from country to region
- Enables sub-regional policy targeting

**Time-Dependent Parameter Update** (`presolve.gms:19-26`):
- **Historical calibration** (≤ `sm_fix_SSP2`):
  - AWMS shares: SSP2 baseline (`presolve.gms:20`)
  - Fuel shares: SSP2 baseline (`presolve.gms:21`)
- **Future projection** (> `sm_fix_SSP2`):
  - AWMS shares: Scenario-based with country blending (`presolve.gms:23-24`)
  - Fuel shares: GDP-scenario dependent (`presolve.gms:25`)

**Scenario Blending Logic**: Allows modeling regional differentiation in AWMS adoption (e.g., "What if EU adopts GoodPractice while Asia continues SSP2?").

### postsolve (`postsolve.gms:10-55`)

**Output Recording**: Save equation levels, marginals, and bounds to `ov_*` and `oq55_*` parameters for R reporting (standard MAgPIE pattern).

### nl_fix, nl_release, nl_relax (`nl_fix.gms`, `nl_release.gms`, `nl_relax.gms`)

**Content**: Empty files (no nonlinear programming relaxation needed for Module 55 equations) (`nl_fix.gms:8`, `nl_release.gms:8`, `nl_relax.gms:8`)

---

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. Mass Balance Approach

**Fundamental Equation** (`equations.gms:63-66`):
```
Manure NPK = Feed NPK - Animal Product NPK
```

**Implementation**:
- Feed NPK: Sum of all feed types × nutrient content (`equations.gms:28-31`)
- Animal Product NPK: `Feed NPK × slaughter_feed_share` (retention fraction) (`equations.gms:71`)
- Manure NPK: `Feed NPK × (1 - slaughter_feed_share)` (`equations.gms:70`)

**Advantages**:
- Conserves nutrients (no magical creation/destruction)
- Captures productivity effects (high-yielding animals retain more N → less manure per unit feed)
- Transparent accounting for nutrient flows

### 2. AWMS Classification by Feed-Manure Nexus

**Principle**: AWMS categorization based on **spatial coupling** of feed source and manure destination (`equations.gms:13-23`).

**4 AWMS Categories**:
1. **Confinement**: Crop-based feed → manure in facilities → recycling to cropland
2. **Grazing**: Pasture feed → manure on pasture → in-situ nutrient cycling
3. **Fuel**: Pasture feed → manure collected → burned as household fuel (nutrients lost)
4. **Stubble Grazing**: Residue feed → manure on cropland → in-situ nutrient cycling

**Simplified Reality** (`equations.gms:16-22`):
- Actual systems more complex (e.g., grass cut and fed in stables, confinement manure applied to pastures)
- Assumption: Cross-flows cancel out in high-income regions (grass removal balanced by manure imports)
- Limitation: May misrepresent nutrient flows in intensive dairy systems (high grass cutting, high manure export to cropland)

### 3. Development State Differentiation

**Residue Feeding** (`equations.gms:31-32,54-55`):
- **Developed regions**: All residues fed in confinement (mechanized collection, storage)
- **Developing regions**: 25% residues grazed on stubble fields (labor-intensive collection)

**Manure Fuel Use** (`equations.gms:40,47`):
- Driven by energy access and poverty
- GDP-scenario dependent (declines with development)
- Reflects fuel transition from traditional biomass to modern energy

**Mechanism**: `im_development_state` parameter (0-1) smoothly interpolates between developing (0) and developed (1) extremes.

### 4. Confinement System Heterogeneity

**9 AWMS Types** (`sets.gms:16-17`):
- **Anaerobic** (lagoon, liquid_slurry, pit_long): High CH₄ emissions, low NH₃ emissions
- **Aerobic** (solid_storage, drylot): Low CH₄ emissions, high NH₃ emissions
- **Rapid Removal** (daily_spread): Minimal storage emissions
- **Mitigation Technology** (digester): CH₄ captured for energy, reduced N losses

**System-Specific Characteristics** (used in Modules 51 & 53):
- Recycling shares: digester (high) vs. lagoon (low) (`preloop.gms:10`)
- Emission factors: anaerobic (high N₂O, CH₄) vs. aerobic (high NH₃, low CH₄)
- Storage duration: pit_long (>1 month) vs. pit_short (<1 month)

**Regional Variation**: `ic55_awms_shr` captures infrastructure, climate, economic factors affecting AWMS choice.

### 5. Scenario-Based Futures

**SSP Scenarios** (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways):
- **SSP1**: Sustainability (high digester share, low lagoon share, rapid fuel transition)
- **SSP2**: Middle-of-the-road (gradual AWMS improvement, slow fuel transition)
- **SSP3**: Regional rivalry (low tech adoption, persistent traditional practices)
- **SSP4**: Inequality (high-tech in developed regions, low-tech in developing)
- **SSP5**: Fossil-fueled development (high digester adoption, rapid fuel transition)

**GoodPractice Scenario**: Best available technology adoption (maximum digester/daily_spread, minimal lagoon/drylot) (`input.gms:13`).

**SRES Scenarios** (older IPCC scenarios): a1, a2, b1, b2 (legacy support) (`input.gms:12`).

### 6. Population-Weighted Country Blending

**Use Case**: Targeted policy analysis at sub-regional scale (`presolve.gms:8-16`).

**Example** (illustrative scenario):
- Select EU countries for GoodPractice scenario
- Rest of Europe under SSP2
- Regional AWMS shares = 60% GoodPractice + 40% SSP2 (weighted by population)

**Formula** (`presolve.gms:23-24`):
```
AWMS_share = Scenario_share × Region_share + Fallback_share × (1 - Region_share)
```

**Advantages**:
- Captures policy diffusion dynamics
- Avoids artificial boundaries at MAgPIE regional borders
- Enables "what-if" policy experiments

| **50** (NR Soil Budget) | `vm_manure_recycling(i,npk)` | Manure nutrients applied to cropland |
| **51** (Nitrogen) | `vm_manure_confinement(i,kli,awms_conf,npk)` | Confinement manure for N emission calculations |

- **No optimization**: Pure accounting module (no decision variables beyond manure distribution)
- **No feedback loops**: Manure management does NOT affect feed choices or livestock production in current implementation

---

## Limitations & Assumptions

### 1. Phosphorus and Potassium Loss Simplification

**What the code does**: Assumes 100% recycling of P and K from all AWMS (`preloop.gms:12-13`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model P runoff from lagoons (eutrophication risk)
- ❌ Does NOT model K leaching from solid storage
- ❌ Does NOT account for P fixation in soil (reduces bioavailability)
- ❌ Does NOT model P accumulation in manure-rich regions (excess application)

**Impact**: Overstates P and K recycling efficiency, underestimates eutrophication risk from AWMS.

### 2. Simplified Feed-Manure Spatial Coupling

**What the code does**: Assumes pasture feed → manure on pasture, crop feed → manure in confinement (`equations.gms:15-22`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model cut-and-carry grass systems (grass harvested, fed in stables, manure to cropland)
- ❌ Does NOT track manure transport from confinements to pastures
- ❌ Does NOT represent zero-grazing dairy systems (all feed brought to barn, manure exported)

**Impact**: May misallocate manure nutrients between cropland and pasture in intensive systems (e.g., European dairy).

### 3. Fixed Development State Thresholds

**What the code does**: Uses 25% stubble grazing fraction for developing regions, 0% for developed (`equations.gms:60-61`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT vary stubble grazing share by livestock type (sheep vs. cattle grazing patterns)
- ❌ Does NOT account for within-region heterogeneity (peri-urban vs. rural areas)
- ❌ Does NOT model adoption dynamics (gradual transition from stubble grazing to confinement feeding)

**Impact**: Binary classification oversimplifies diverse management practices within regions.

### 4. No Seasonal Dynamics

**What the code does**: Calculates annual average manure flows per timestep (`equations.gms:26-87`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model seasonal storage (winter accumulation, spring application)
- ❌ Does NOT represent grazing season variability (housed in winter, grazing in summer)
- ❌ Does NOT account for monsoon effects on lagoon overflow (Asian rice-livestock systems)
- ❌ Does NOT capture freeze-thaw emission pulses

**Impact**: Cannot evaluate timing-dependent mitigation strategies (e.g., fall vs. spring manure application).

### 5. No Manure Export/Import

**What the code does**: All recycled manure applied within the same region (`equations.gms:83-87`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT model inter-regional manure trade (nutrient hotspot → nutrient deficit areas)
- ❌ Does NOT represent processing (drying, pelletizing) for long-distance transport
- ❌ Does NOT account for manure disposal costs (affects recycling incentive)
- ❌ Does NOT model nutrient accumulation in livestock-dense regions (Midwest US, Brittany, Netherlands)

**Impact**: Misses spatial mismatch between manure production and crop demand (local oversupply/undersupply).

### 6. Exogenous AWMS Shares

**What the code does**: Uses scenario-prescribed AWMS shares (`ic55_awms_shr`) (`presolve.gms:23-24`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT optimize AWMS choice based on costs and emissions
- ❌ Does NOT respond to GHG prices (no endogenous digester adoption)
- ❌ Does NOT capture infrastructure constraints (capital for lagoon construction)
- ❌ Does NOT model technology diffusion (neighbor effects, learning curves)

**Impact**: AWMS transitions predetermined by scenario, not economically optimized (misses policy-induced shifts).

### 7. No Manure Quality Variation

**What the code does**: Uses uniform nutrient content within feed types (`fm_attributes`) (`equations.gms:28-31`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT vary manure N:P:K ratio by diet composition (high-protein vs. high-fiber)
- ❌ Does NOT account for bedding dilution (straw bedding increases manure volume, decreases nutrient density)
- ❌ Does NOT model composting effects (N losses, organic matter transformation)
- ❌ Does NOT represent antibiotics/hormones in manure (affects decomposition and soil microbiology)

**Impact**: Misses diet-manure quality linkages (e.g., reduced crude protein diet → lower manure N).

### 8. No Land Application Constraints

**What the code does**: Calculates total recycled manure (`vm_manure_recycling`) without application limits (`equations.gms:83-87`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT constrain manure application by cropland area (avoids over-application)
- ❌ Does NOT account for crop N/P/K demand (excess nutrients not modeled)
- ❌ Does NOT model soil P saturation limits (environmental regulations)
- ❌ Does NOT represent farmer acceptance (odor, pathogens, handling costs)

**Impact**: Implicit assumption that all recycled manure is beneficially used (reality: some regions have manure surplus → disposal challenge).

### 9. Preprocessed Slaughter Share

**What the code does**: Uses exogenous `im_slaughter_feed_share` parameter (`equations.gms:71`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT recalculate retention share based on endogenous productivity (Module 70 productivity changes)
- ❌ Does NOT account for body weight dynamics (growing animals retain more N than mature animals)
- ❌ Does NOT model reproductive cycle effects (lactating animals different from dry animals)
- ❌ Does NOT represent feed efficiency improvements (better conversion → higher retention, less manure)

**Impact**: Static retention shares may not reflect endogenous livestock system changes (e.g., intensification effects on manure production).

### 10. No Manure-Based Emissions Feedback

**What the code does**: Provides manure data to emission modules (51, 53) (`module.gms:13`)

**What the code does NOT do**:
- ❌ Does NOT allow GHG prices to change AWMS choice (Module 56 → Module 55 feedback missing)
- ❌ Does NOT optimize manure management for emission reduction (digesters not chosen for CH₄ mitigation)
- ❌ Does NOT represent emission-based regulations (AWMS technology mandates not modeled)
- ❌ Does NOT capture co-benefits (digester reduces emissions AND produces energy → revenue)

**Impact**: Emission mitigation potential of improved AWMS underestimated (no economic incentive for adoption).

## Alternative Realization: `off`

**Purpose**: Disables animal waste management calculations (used for model testing or non-livestock scenarios).

**Implementation**: Sets all AWMS variables to zero (checked via module folder structure, not documented in detail here).

## Scenario Descriptions

### SSP Scenarios (Illustrative Trends)

**Note**: Actual AWMS share trajectories are scenario-specific input data (`f55_awms_shr.cs4`). The following are conceptual characterizations based on SSP narratives, not quantitative values.

**SSP1 (Sustainability)**:
- Rapid adoption of digesters and biogas systems
- Phase-out of open lagoons (high CH₄, water pollution)
- Strong environmental regulations drive tech improvement
- High manure fuel transition (energy access expansion)

**SSP2 (Middle-of-the-Road)**:
- Gradual improvement in AWMS (slow tech adoption)
- Mixed systems: some digester uptake, lagoons persist in cost-sensitive regions
- Moderate fuel transition (some regions lag)

**SSP3 (Regional Rivalry)**:
- Low technology adoption (limited international cooperation)
- Persistence of traditional systems (open storage, minimal treatment)
- Slow fuel transition (energy poverty persists)

**SSP4 (Inequality)**:
- Developed regions: high-tech AWMS (digesters, daily spread)
- Developing regions: low-tech AWMS (lagoons, drylot, fuel collection)
- Divergence in manure management quality

**SSP5 (Fossil-Fueled Development)**:
- High investment in intensive livestock facilities
- Digester adoption for energy production (biogas offsets fossil fuels)
- Rapid fuel transition (cheap fossil fuels displace dung)

**GoodPractice**:
- Best available technology (BAT) scenario
- Maximum digester, daily_spread, covered storage
- Minimal lagoon, drylot, open systems
- Represents technical mitigation potential (cost-unconstrained)

## Code Quality Notes

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Transparent accounting**: Mass balance approach ensures nutrient conservation
2. **Feed-manure nexus**: Logical AWMS classification based on spatial coupling
3. **Scenario flexibility**: Supports 12 scenarios + country-level customization
4. **Development differentiation**: Captures structural differences between developed/developing regions
5. **Downstream integration**: Provides well-structured data for emission calculations (Modules 51, 53)

### ⚠️ Considerations

1. **P and K oversimplification**: 100% recycling assumption unrealistic (runoff, leaching ignored)
2. **Exogenous AWMS shares**: No optimization (misses policy-induced mitigation)
3. **No spatial constraints**: Recycled manure not bounded by cropland area (over-application risk)
4. **Static feed-manure coupling**: Doesn't capture intensive system complexities (cut-and-carry, manure export)
5. **Preprocessed retention shares**: Not responsive to endogenous productivity changes

## Example Calculation (Illustrative)

**Scenario**: Calculate manure nitrogen recycled to cropland from dairy cattle in a hypothetical region.

**Given** (made-up numbers for illustration):
- Dairy feed intake:
  - Crops (kcr): 5 Mt DM, N content = 2% → 0.1 Mt N
  - Pasture: 10 Mt DM, N content = 3% → 0.3 Mt N
- Development state: 0.5 (semi-developed)
- Manure fuel share: 0 (no fuel collection)
- Slaughter feed share (N): 0.05 (5% retained in milk)
- Confinement AWMS shares:
  - Lagoon: 40%
  - Solid storage: 60%
- Recycling shares:
  - Lagoon: 0.5 (50% N losses)
  - Solid storage: 0.7 (30% N losses)

**Step 1**: Feed Intake Allocation

Confinement (Eq. 1):
```
= 0.1 Mt (crops)
  * [1 - (1-0.5)*0.25]    (residue adjustment: 87.5%)
= 0.1 × 0.875 = 0.0875 Mt N
```

Grazing (Eq. 2):
```
= 0.3 Mt (pasture) * (1 - 0) = 0.3 Mt N
```

**Step 2**: Manure Calculation (Eq. 5)

Confinement manure:
```
= 0.0875 × (1 - 0.05) = 0.083 Mt N
```

Grazing manure:
```
= 0.3 × (1 - 0.05) = 0.285 Mt N
```

**Step 3**: Confinement Distribution (Eq. 6)

Lagoon:
```
= 0.083 × 0.4 = 0.0332 Mt N
```

Solid storage:
```
= 0.083 × 0.6 = 0.0498 Mt N
```

**Step 4**: Recycling to Cropland (Eq. 7)

```
= 0.0332 × 0.5 + 0.0498 × 0.7
= 0.0166 + 0.0349
= 0.0515 Mt N recycled
```

**Interpretation**:
- Total manure: 0.368 Mt N (confinement + grazing)
- Recycled to cropland: 0.0515 Mt N (14% of total, 62% of confinement manure)
- Grazing manure (0.285 Mt N): stays on pasture → Module 51 pasture emissions
- Confinement losses: (0.083 - 0.0515) / 0.083 = 38% N lost during storage → Module 51 AWMS emissions

**Arithmetic Check**:
- Confinement manure: 0.0332 + 0.0498 = 0.083 ✓
- Recycling: 0.0166 + 0.0349 = 0.0515 ✓

**Note**: All numbers in this example are illustrative. Actual values require reading input data files (`f55_awms_shr.cs4`, `f55_awms_recycling_share.cs4`, livestock productivity data from Module 70).
