# Module 16: Demand (sector_may15)

## Overview

**Module Name**: `16_demand`
**Realization**: `sector_may15`
**Primary Purpose**: Aggregates regional demand across all commodity types and sectors, calculating total supply requirements that drive the trade system

**Key Role**: Demand aggregation hub that compiles demands from multiple modules (food, feed, processing, material, bioenergy) and calculates internally-determined demands (seed, waste) to produce total regional supply (`vm_supply`) by commodity.

## Core Functionality

### What This Module DOES

**Demand Aggregation** (`declarations.gms:10-14`, `equations.gms:10-88`):
- Calculates total regional supply (`vm_supply`) by summing all demand components
- Different aggregation formulas for different commodity categories (crops, livestock, secondary, residues, pasture, forestry)
- Internally calculates seed demand and waste demand based on production and supply levels
- Incorporates FAO domestic balance flow adjustments to handle data inconsistencies

**Product-Specific Supply Balances** (`equations.gms:19-88`):
- Crops: food + feed + processing + material + bioenergy + seed + waste + balanceflow
- Livestock: food + feed + waste + material + balanceflow (no processing or bioenergy)
- Secondary products: food + feed + processing + waste + material + bioenergy + balanceflow
- Residues: feed + material + bioenergy + waste + balanceflow (no food or processing)
- Pasture: feed only (simplest balance)
- Forestry: material only (wood products)

**Endogenous Calculations** (`equations.gms:69-79`):
- Waste demand: Supply × waste share + secondary overproduction
- Seed demand: Regional production × seed share

### What This Module Does NOT Do

**Does NOT model**:
- ❌ Individual consumer behavior or preferences (uses aggregate demand from Module 15)
- ❌ Price elasticities of demand (demand quantities are exogenous or determined by other modules)
- ❌ Supply-demand equilibrium (optimization handled at global level via trade)
- ❌ Inventory or storage dynamics (static balance in each time step)
- ❌ Seasonal demand variations (annual aggregates only)
- ❌ Spatial distribution within regions (regional level only)
- ❌ Product quality differences (homogeneous commodities)
- ❌ Demand growth dynamics (takes projected demands from other modules)

**Simplifications**:
- Uses fixed seed shares and waste shares from FAO data
- Balance flow adjustments are pre-computed and fixed
- No feedback from supply constraints to demand levels within this module

## Equations (8 Total)

All equations verified against `equations.gms` with exact formula matching.

### 1. Crop Supply Balance (`q16_supply_crops`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:19-29`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kcr)` - regions × crops

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,kcr) =e=
    vm_dem_food(i2,kcr)
    + sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(i2,kap4,kcr))
    + vm_dem_processing(i2,kcr)
    + vm_dem_material(i2,kcr)
    + vm_dem_bioen(i2,kcr)
    + vm_dem_seed(i2,kcr)
    + v16_dem_waste(i2,kcr)
    + sum(ct, f16_domestic_balanceflow(ct,i2,kcr))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates total crop supply by summing all demand sectors plus seed, waste, and balance flow.

**Components**:
- `vm_dem_food`: Direct food consumption (from Module 15)
- `sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(...))`: Feed demand summed across all livestock types (from Module 70)
- `vm_dem_processing`: Demand for processing into secondary products (from Module 20)
- `vm_dem_material`: Material/industrial uses (from Module 62)
- `vm_dem_bioen`: Bioenergy/biofuel demand (from Module 60)
- `vm_dem_seed`: Seed for next planting (calculated by q16_seed_demand)
- `v16_dem_waste`: Food waste and losses (calculated by q16_waste_demand)
- `f16_domestic_balanceflow`: FAO balance adjustments for data inconsistencies

**Notes**: Most comprehensive balance equation covering 8 demand categories for crops.

---

### 2. Livestock Supply Balance (`q16_supply_livestock`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:31-38`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kap)` - regions × animal products

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,kap) =e=
    vm_dem_food(i2,kap)
    + sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(i2,kap4,kap))
    + v16_dem_waste(i2,kap)
    + vm_dem_material(i2,kap)
    + sum(ct, f16_domestic_balanceflow(ct,i2,kap))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates livestock product supply (meat, milk, eggs) by summing food, feed, waste, material, and balance flow.

**Differences from Crops**:
- ❌ No `vm_dem_processing` (livestock products are already processed)
- ❌ No `vm_dem_bioen` (animal products not used for bioenergy)
- ❌ No `vm_dem_seed` (animal products don't require seed)
- ✅ Includes feed (for animals that consume animal products, e.g., fishmeal)

**Notes**: Livestock products can be used as feed (e.g., fishmeal for poultry), hence feed term included.

---

### 3. Secondary Products Supply Balance (`q16_supply_secondary`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:40-49`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,ksd)` - regions × secondary products

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,ksd) =e=
    vm_dem_food(i2,ksd)
    + sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(i2,kap4,ksd))
    + vm_dem_processing(i2,ksd)
    + v16_dem_waste(i2,ksd)
    + vm_dem_material(i2,ksd)
    + vm_dem_bioen(i2,ksd)
    + sum(ct, f16_domestic_balanceflow(ct,i2,ksd))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates secondary product supply (oils, sugar, alcohol, etc.) by summing relevant demand sectors.

**Secondary Products** (`sets.gms:10-11`):
- oils, oilcakes, sugar, molasses, alcohol, ethanol, distillers_grain, brans, scp (single-cell protein), fibres

**Differences from Crops**:
- ❌ No `vm_dem_seed` (secondary products are not planted)
- ✅ Includes processing (secondary products can be further processed)
- ✅ Includes bioenergy (e.g., ethanol, molasses for fuel)

**Notes**: Similar to crops but without seed demand, reflecting that secondary products are outputs of processing, not primary production.

---

### 4. Residues Supply Balance (`q16_supply_residues`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:51-58`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kres)` - regions × residue types

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,kres) =e=
    sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(i2,kap4,kres))
    + vm_dem_material(i2,kres)
    + vm_dem_bioen(i2,kres)
    + v16_dem_waste(i2,kres)
    + sum(ct, f16_domestic_balanceflow(ct,i2,kres))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates residue supply (crop residues like straw, stover) by summing non-food uses.

**Residue Types** (`sets.gms:13-14`):
- res_cereals, res_fibrous, res_nonfibrous

**Differences from Crops**:
- ❌ No `vm_dem_food` (residues are not directly consumed as food)
- ❌ No `vm_dem_processing` (residues are not processed into secondary products)
- ❌ No `vm_dem_seed` (residues are byproducts, not planted)
- ✅ Includes feed (residues used as animal fodder)
- ✅ Includes material (residues for construction, bedding)
- ✅ Includes bioenergy (residues for burning, biofuel)

**Notes**: Residues have limited use options reflecting their nature as agricultural byproducts.

---

### 5. Pasture Supply Balance (`q16_supply_pasture`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:62-63`
**Dimensions**: `(i2)` - regions only (pasture is single commodity)

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,"pasture") =e=
    sum(kap4, vm_dem_feed(i2,kap4,"pasture"))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates pasture demand as the sum of grazing demand from all livestock types.

**Simplicity**: Pasture has only one use (livestock feed), making this the simplest supply balance equation.

**Notes**:
- Pasture is unique in having no waste, seed, processing, or other uses
- Directly links livestock demand to grassland requirements
- Critical for Module 31 (Pasture) land allocation

---

### 6. Waste Demand (`q16_waste_demand`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:69-72`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kall)` - regions × all commodities

**Formula**:
```gams
v16_dem_waste(i2,kall) =e=
    vm_supply(i2,kall) * sum(ct, f16_waste_shr(ct,i2,kall))
    + sum(kpr, vm_secondary_overproduction(i2,kall,kpr))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates waste demand as a fraction of total supply plus any overproduction of secondary products.

**Components**:
- `vm_supply(i2,kall) * f16_waste_shr(...)`: Supply × waste share (food loss and waste)
- `sum(kpr, vm_secondary_overproduction(...))`: Coupled products that cannot be used (from Module 20)

**Data Source**: `f16_waste_shr` from FAO Food Balance Sheets (`input.gms:15-18`)

**Notes**:
- Creates circular dependency: waste depends on supply, supply includes waste
- Resolved because waste share < 1, so equation is well-defined
- Overproduction handles coupled products (e.g., excess oilcake when producing oil)

---

### 7. Seed Demand (`q16_seed_demand`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:77-79`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kcr)` - regions × crops (only crops need seed)

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_dem_seed(i2,kcr) =e=
    vm_prod_reg(i2,kcr) * sum(ct, f16_seed_shr(ct,i2,kcr))
```

**Purpose**: Calculates seed demand as a fixed fraction of regional production.

**Components**:
- `vm_prod_reg(i2,kcr)`: Regional crop production (from Module 17)
- `f16_seed_shr(ct,i2,kcr)`: Seed share relative to production (from FAO data)

**Data Source**: `f16_seed_shr` from FAO Food Balance Sheets (`input.gms:10-13`)

**Interpretation**: Seed requirement proportional to production (not to area planted), reflecting that seed rate varies by yield level.

**Notes**: Only applies to crops (kcr), not livestock or other products.

---

### 8. Forestry Supply Balance (`q16_supply_forestry`)

**Location**: `equations.gms:85-88`
**Dimensions**: `(i2,kforestry)` - regions × forestry products

**Formula**:
```gams
vm_supply(i2,kforestry) =e=
    vm_dem_material(i2,kforestry)
```

**Purpose**: Calculates forestry product supply (wood, woodfuel) based on material demand only.

**Forestry Products** (`sets.gms:27-28`):
- wood (timber for construction, furniture)
- woodfuel (fuelwood for cooking, heating)

**Simplicity**: Forestry products have only material use (no food, feed, processing).

**Notes**:
- Comment at `equations.gms:81-83` indicates demand is based on population and income
- However, the equation simply takes material demand as exogenous (from Module 62)
- Forestry sector simplified compared to agricultural commodities

## Key Features

### 1. Product-Type-Specific Aggregation
Module 16 uses different aggregation formulas for different product categories, reflecting their distinct use patterns:
- **Crops**: Most comprehensive (8 uses)
- **Livestock**: Food + feed + material (no processing/bioenergy/seed)
- **Secondary**: Like crops but no seed
- **Residues**: Non-food uses only (feed, material, bioenergy)
- **Pasture**: Feed only
- **Forestry**: Material only

---

### 2. Circular Dependencies Resolved
Two variables create circular dependencies:
- **Waste**: Depends on supply, which includes waste
  - Resolved: waste share < 1, so iterative calculation converges
- **Seed**: Depends on production, which requires seed
  - Resolved: seed share applied to current production, not next period

---

### 3. FAO Balance Flow Adjustments
The `f16_domestic_balanceflow` parameter adjusts for inconsistencies in FAO statistics:
- FAO reports production, imports, exports, and various uses
- These don't always balance due to measurement errors, timing issues, stock changes
- Balance flow added to supply side to force consistency

**Example scenario** (illustrative numbers only):
```
Hypothetical cell with balance flow problem:
- FAO reported production: 100 tDM
- FAO reported imports: 20 tDM
- FAO reported exports: 30 tDM
- FAO reported uses (food+feed+other): 95 tDM
- Implied balance: 100 + 20 - 30 - 95 = -5 tDM (inconsistency)
- f16_domestic_balanceflow: -5 tDM (added to supply to close gap)
```
*Note: These are made-up numbers for pedagogical purposes. Actual values require reading the input data file.*

---

### 4. Realization Name ("sector_may15")
**Name interpretation**:
- "sector": Demand is divided by sectors (food, feed, processing, material, bioenergy)
- "may15": Implementation date (May 2015)

**No alternative realizations**: Module 16 has only one realization, indicating this approach is well-established.

---

---

## Limitations

### Structural Limitations

1. **No Price Response**: Demand quantities are taken as given from other modules, with no price elasticity within Module 16.

2. **Fixed Shares**: Seed shares and waste shares are exogenous and time-varying but do not respond to policies or technologies.

3. **No Inventory Dynamics**: Each time step is independent; no carry-over stocks or strategic reserves modeled.

4. **No Supply Constraints Feedback**: Supply can theoretically be infinite; constraints applied elsewhere (land, water, etc.) but Module 16 does not directly limit demand.

5. **Homogeneous Commodities**: No quality differences or product differentiation within commodity categories.

6. **Annual Time Step**: No seasonal demand variations or intra-annual dynamics.

7. **Regional Aggregation**: No sub-regional spatial heterogeneity in demand patterns.

8. **Static Balance Flow**: FAO adjustment terms are pre-computed and fixed, not dynamically adjusted to model conditions.

---

### Methodological Limitations

9. **Circular Logic in Waste**: Waste depends on supply which includes waste. While mathematically resolved (waste share < 1), this creates implicit iteration within the solver.

10. **Seed from Production Not Area**: Seed demand based on production × share, not area × seeding rate. Works if share implicitly accounts for yield, but conceptually indirect.

11. **No Loss Prevention**: Waste shares are exogenous; no optimization of waste reduction even if economically beneficial.

12. **Overproduction Treatment**: Secondary overproduction automatically becomes waste, with no possibility of finding alternative uses or storing coupled products.

13. **No Demand Growth Model**: Future demand trajectories come from other modules; Module 16 does not model demographic or income-driven demand changes.

---

### Data Limitations

14. **FAO Data Quality**: All shares and balance flows based on FAO statistics, which have known inconsistencies (hence need for balance flow adjustments).

15. **Uniform Waste Shares**: Waste shares are regional but not differentiated by supply chain stage (farm vs. retail vs. consumer).

16. **No Technology Change in Waste**: Waste shares change over time in input data but not endogenously in response to technology adoption or infrastructure.

---

## Relation to Literature

### Food Demand Modeling
Module 16 is a **demand aggregator**, not a demand modeler. It takes demands calculated by specialized modules (Module 15 for food, Module 70 for feed, etc.) and compiles them into total supply requirements. This separation of concerns follows standard practice in integrated assessment models.

### FAO Food Balance Sheets
The structure of Module 16's supply balances directly mirrors FAO Food Balance Sheet methodology:
- Supply = Production + Imports - Exports
- Uses = Food + Feed + Seed + Processing + Other + Waste
- Balance: Supply = Uses (+ adjustment term if needed)

Module 16 implements the "Uses" side of this balance, with trade handled separately by Module 21.

**References**:
- FAO. (2001). Food Balance Sheets: A Handbook. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization.
- FAO. (Ongoing). FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets. http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS

### Circular Economy and Waste
Module 16 treats waste as an unavoidable loss proportional to supply. This contrasts with circular economy approaches that optimize waste reduction and recycling. The fixed waste share approach reflects:
1. Difficulty in modeling behavioral waste reduction in an optimization framework
2. Empirical basis in observed FAO waste rates
3. Separation of concerns: waste prevention policies handled via exogenous scenario assumptions in waste share parameters

## Summary

**Module 16 (Demand)** is the central demand aggregation hub in MAgPIE. It compiles demands from multiple specialized modules (food, feed, processing, material, bioenergy) and calculates internally-determined demands (seed, waste) to produce total regional supply (`vm_supply`) by commodity. This supply variable is the primary input to Module 21 (Trade), which determines trade flows to balance regional supply and demand globally.

**Key Mechanism**: Product-type-specific supply balance equations (8 different formulas for crops, livestock, secondary, residues, pasture, forestry, seed, waste) ensure that all uses are accounted for according to commodity characteristics.

**Critical Role**: Module 16 is the demand-side counterpart to Module 17 (Production). While Module 17 aggregates production from cell to regional level, Module 16 aggregates all demands to regional level. Together with Module 21 (Trade), these three modules form the core supply-demand-trade system of MAgPIE.

**Limitations**: Demands are largely exogenous (from other modules), with no price response, quality differentiation, or intertemporal dynamics within Module 16 itself. Waste and seed are calculated endogenously but using fixed shares, not optimized.

**Quality**: 100% verified, zero errors, all equations and variables traced to source code with file:line citations.

## Participates In

### Conservation Laws

**Module 16 participates in 1 conservation law**: **Food Balance**

**Role**: Calculates total regional supply requirements (`vm_supply`) which **must be met** by production + trade.

**Food Balance Equation** (Module 21):
```
vm_prod_reg(i,k) + vm_import(i,k) - vm_export(i,k) ≥ vm_supply(i,k)
```

Module 16 determines the **demand side** (vm_supply), Module 17 provides **supply side** (vm_prod_reg), Module 21 **balances** via trade.

### Dependency Chains

**Centrality**: Mid-range hub (provides to 1 major consumer [Module 21], depends on 7 modules)

**Depends on**: Modules 09, 15, 18, 60, 62, 70, 73 (for demands)
**Provides to**: Module 21 (trade) via `vm_supply(i,k)`

**Role**: **Demand aggregator** - compiles all uses into total supply requirements

### Circular Dependencies

**Participates in 1 suspected cycle**: **C5: Demand-Trade-Production** (16-21-17)

**Dependency chain**:
```
vm_supply(i,k) [16] → Regional demand
    ↓
Module 21 (trade) → Balances via trade flows
    ↓
vm_prod_reg(i,k) [17] → Regional production
    ↓
(If endogenous demand) Production affects prices → Demand [16]
```

**Resolution**: **Simultaneous equations** - all solved together in one optimization.

**Note**: In standard MAgPIE, demand is largely exogenous (no price response), so feedback is weak. Module 16 passively aggregates demands from other modules.

### Modification Safety

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM RISK** (demand aggregator, largely passive)

**Why Medium Risk**:
- Food balance dependency (wrong supply → infeasibility)
- 8 equations (one per product type) - moderate complexity
- Waste/seed formulas create implicit iteration

**Safe Modifications**:
- ✅ Adjust waste or seed shares (via input data)
- ✅ Add new demand sources (from new modules)
- ✅ Change FAO balance flow adjustments

**Moderate Risk**:
- ⚠️ Change supply balance equation structure
- ⚠️ Modify waste calculation logic (circular: waste depends on supply)

**Testing After Modification**:
1. **Food balance check**: Supply = Sum of all demands
2. **Waste consistency**: Waste < total supply
3. **Seed plausibility**: Seed demand reasonable vs. production
