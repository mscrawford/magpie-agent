# Cross-Module Analysis (Phase 2)

This directory will contain documentation for:
- Conservation laws (land, water, carbon, nitrogen, food balances)
- Common workflows (add crop, modify yields, implement policies)
- Dependency analysis (circular dependencies, cascade effects)
- Emergent behaviors (solver patterns, constraint binding)

See CURRENT_STATE.json for current progress and priorities.
